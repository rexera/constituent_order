Code by me and ChatGPT. 🤪

Camera-ready paper (lol) is in `paper` directory and was originally in Chinese. A crude English translation is also provided in said directory, with no effort spent on language polishing for just making it readable for any non-Chinese speaker.

Since no one would ever reproduce this, I'm not going to provide any instructions and final organization on the code itself and how to run the code. If interested, you're more than welcomed to contact me via email. [See my profile page here!](https://rexera.github.io/about/)

...and there's probably no one interested in citing this work I guess? But if you do, please e-mail me. Beyond thanks!
