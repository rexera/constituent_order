MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. â€” Floyd Mayweather Jr. outclassed YouTube personality Logan Paul but couldn't stop him inside the distance. Mayweather and Paul boxed an eight-round exhibition Sunday night at Hard Rock Stadium. With the bout not being scored, no winner was declared. The 44-year-old Mayweather used the ring skills that propelled him to world titles in five divisions and a 50-0 career record to frustrate Paul with solid lead and counter shots.

"He's better than I thought he was. Good little work. Tonight was a fun night." Mayweather, who won titles in the super-featherweight, lightweight, super-lightweight, welterweight and super-welterweight divisions, has said he will not return to competitive boxing.

But Paul's lack of boxing skills left him open to Mayweather's short left hooks to the head and rights to the body. "He used his weight and tried to tie me up," Mayweather said. Earlier, former Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chad Johnson boxed a four-round exhibition against multi-combat sport veteran Brian Maxwell. Like the Mayweather-Paul exhibition there was no scoring, but Johnson avoided a knockout loss after he was floored with an overall right to the head in the final round. Johnson, in his first boxing event, survived the remainder of the round. The 43-year-old Johnson scored with a solid right to the head in the opening minute of the bout and landed combinations to the head in the second round.
