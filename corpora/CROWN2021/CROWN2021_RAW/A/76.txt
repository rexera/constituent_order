When Olympic diver Tom Daley announced in 2013 that he was dating a man and "couldn't be happier," his coming out was an act of courage that, with its rarity, also exposed how the top echelons of sport weren't seen as a safe space by the vast majority of LGBTQ athletes. Back then, the number of gay Olympians who felt able and willing to speak openly about their private lives could be counted on a few hands. There'd been just two dozen openly gay Olympians among the more than 10,000 who competed at the 2012 London Games, a reflection of how unrepresentative and anachronistic top-tier sports were just a decade ago and, to a large extent, still are. Still, at the Tokyo Games, the picture is changing. A wave of rainbow-colored pride, openness and acceptance is sweeping through Olympic pools, skateparks, halls and fields, with a record number of openly gay competitors in Tokyo. Whereas LGBTQ invisibility used to make Olympic sports seem out of step with the times, Tokyo is shaping up as a watershed for the community and for the Games â€” now, finally, starting to better reflect human diversity. "It's about time that everyone was able to be who they are and celebrated for it," said U.S. skateboarder Alexis Sablone, one of at least five openly LGBTQ athletes in that sport making its Olympic debut in Tokyo. "It's really cool," Sablone said. "What I hope that means is that even outside of sports, kids are raised not just under the assumption that they are heterosexual." The gay website Outsports.com has been tallying the number of publicly out gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer and nonbinary athletes in Tokyo. After several updates, its count is now up to 168, including some who petitioned to get on the list. That's three times the number that Outsports tallied at the last Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. At the London Games, it counted just 23. "The massive increase in the number of out athletes reflects the growing acceptance of LGBTQ people in sports and society," Outsports says. Daley is also broadcasting that message from Tokyo, his fourth Olympics overall and second since he came out. After winning gold for Britain with Matty Lee in 10-meter synchronized diving, the 27-year-old reflected on his journey from young misfit who felt "alone and different" to Olympic champion who says he now feels less pressure to perform because he knows that his husband and their son love him regardless.
