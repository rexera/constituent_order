A New Tale of Two C's: CROWN2021 and Upcoming CLOB2021

CROWN2021 is a balanced Brown family American English corpus of one million words containing texts published in 2021. It was developed under the leadership of Prof. Jiajin Xu and the texts were collected by Mingchen Sun and 12 other graduate students at Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU). CROWN2021 serves as updated language resource of present-day American written English, and a reference corpus for contrastive studies involving diachronic variation (with Brown, Frown, Crown), regional variation (with LOB, FLOB, CLOB) and cross-linguistic comparison (with LCMC, ToRCH family corpora, GLOBE family corpora). Users can have access to the online version of CROWN2021 and other BFSU-made Brown family corpora at BFSU CQPweb Corpus Portal (http://114.251.154.212/cqp/). Both user ID and passcode are "test".
