<S>A bipartisan elections bill</S> <V>is</V> <O>the rarest of creatures</O>, <O>one many Americans have never seen in the wild</O>.
<S>Congressional Democrats</S><V>are united</V><place>behind sweeping voting rights legislation</place><S><V>won't pass</V><O>the Senate</O><condition>so long as the filibuster exists</condition>,<cause>because Republicans are united against it</cause>.
<S>Republican legislators</S> <place>in Texas, Georgia, Florida and elsewhere</place> <V>have passed</V> <O>numerous voting restrictions</O> <cause>over united Democratic opposition</cause>.
<condition>But on one sliver of voting issues</condition>, <S>it</S> <V>seems lawmakers might — might! — be able</V> <effect>to agree</effect>.
<S>The Native American Voting Rights Act, or NAVRA</S><V>was introduced</V><time>in the House last month</time><manner>by Representatives Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, and Sharice Davids, Democrat of Kansas</manner>.
<S>Senator Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico</S><V>introduced</V><O>companion legislation</O><place>in the Senate</place>.
<S>It</S><V>would let</V><O>tribes</O><V>determine</V><O>the number and location of voter registration sites, polling places and ballot drop boxes</O><place>on their reservations</place>; <V>bar</V><O>states</O><V>from closing or consolidating those sites</V><condition>without tribal consent</condition>; <V>require</V><O>states with voter identification laws</O><V>to accept</V><O>tribal ID</O>; <V>and create</V><O>a $10 million grant program</O><purpose>for state-level task forces to examine barriers to voting access for Native Americans</purpose>.
<S>The bill</S> <V>is</V> <place>in the earliest stages of the legislative process</place><cause>— endorsed by many Native American tribes, as well as advocacy groups such as the Native American Rights Fund, the National Congress of American Indians and Four Directions</cause> —.
<S>It</S><V>hasn't even had</V><O>a committee hearing</O>.
<S>Congress</S> <V>has been</V> <manner>rather preoccupied</manner> <place>with matters like stopping the government from shutting down or defaulting on its debt</place>.
<S>the broad voting rights measures</S> <V>are</V> <effect>a high priority for Democrats</effect>, <S>NAVRA</S> <V>is</V> <effect>much lower on the list</effect>.
<S>there</S> <V>is</V> <O>no telling how many Republicans besides Mr. Cole will get on board</O>.
<S>All of which</S> <V>is to say</V> <O>that passage, or even a vote, is far from guaranteed</O>.
<S>It</S> <V>might become</V> <O>law</O>, <concession>or it might go nowhere</concession>.
<S>the mere existence</S> <V>of a voting rights bill with bipartisan sponsors is noteworthy</V>.
<S>I</S> <V>spoke</V> <O>with Mr. Cole, Ms. Davids and Mr. Luján</O> <time>this month</time> <purpose>about the legislation and its prospects</purpose>.
<S>Mr. Cole</S> <V>said</V> <O>that he and Ms. Davids — the leaders of the Congressional Native American Caucus, and two of only five Indigenous members of Congress — had decided what to include in the bill, and what not to</O>, <purpose>with bipartisan support in mind</purpose>.
<S>President Biden</S> <V>has been</V> <effect>so eager to move past the Trump era</effect> <cause>that he prefers to call his predecessor "the former guy" rather than utter his name</cause>.
<S>Mr. Biden</S> <V>has found himself</V> <place>in the uncomfortable position</place> <effect>of being compared over and over again to Donald J.</effect>
<S>Trump</S>
<S>Foreign policy experts and even some of his own allies</S> <V>have invoked</V> <O>the T-word</O> <place>on issues such as immigration, treatment of foreign allies and the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan</place>.
<S>The comparisons</S> <V>have prompted</V> <O>the White House</O> <purpose>to underscore points of contrast — its focus on climate, the end of dictating policy by Twitter — to push back on any sense that Mr. Biden represents something less than a clean break from the slash-and-burn politics of the past four years</purpose>. "<S>I</S> <V>think</V> <S>we're</S> <V>in</V> <O>a bit of a different place</O>," <S>Jen Psaki</S>, <O>the White House press secretary</O>, <V>said</V> <time>at a briefing on Thursday</time> <condition>when asked about recent comparisons</condition>. "<S>People</S> <V>would be pretty hard-pressed</V> <effect>to argue that the president has taken any aspect of the former president's playbook and used it as a model of his own</effect>." <place>In terms of tone and temperament</place>, <S>the two men</S> <V>are hardly alike</V>.
<S>Mr. Biden</S> <V>is finding</V> <condition>that when it comes to policy</condition>, <S>it</S> <V>is not always easy</V> <effect>to draw a clear line separating himself from Mr. Trump</effect>.
<S>Jean-Yves Le Drian</S>, <S>the French foreign minister</S>, <V>said</V> <S>he</S> <V>was livid</V> <cause>at how the United States circumvented France to cut a deal with Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines</cause>. <S>"This brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision</S> <V>reminds</V> <S>me</S> <O>a lot of what Mr. Trump used to do,"</O> <S>Mr. Le Drian</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>Derrick Johnson</S>, <S>the president of the N.A.A.C.P.</S>, <time>last week</time> <V>referred</V> <O>to Mr. Trump</O> <manner>in criticizing the Biden administration's decision</manner> <purpose>to turn back hundreds of Haitian migrants trying to enter the United States</purpose>. "<condition>If we were to close our eyes</condition> <concession>and this was occurring under the Trump administration</concession>, <O>what would we do</O>?" <S>Mr. Johnson</S> <V>said</V>, <purpose>warning the administration that his group had no permanent friends, only permanent interests</purpose>.
<S>Richard Haass</S>, <S>the president of the Council on Foreign Relations</S>, <V>argued</V> <time>in a scathing article in Foreign Affairs published this week</time> <effect>that there was "far more continuity between the foreign policy of the current president and that of the former president than is typically recognized."</effect>
<S>The House Intelligence Committee</S> <V>approved</V> <O>a bipartisan proposal</O> <time>on Thursday</time> <purpose>to provide additional resources to help find the cause of Havana syndrome illnesses</purpose> <purpose>and take steps to review the C.I.A.'s handling of the mysterious episodes</purpose> <effect>that have injured more than 200 government officials</effect>.
<S>The measure</S><V>would overhaul</V><O>the agency's office of medical services</O> and <V>create</V> a <manner>voluntary</manner> system where <S>C.I.A. officers assigned overseas</S> <V>could first receive</V> <O>brain scans and lab work</O> that <V>would help</V> <O>doctors</O> <purpose>determine the extent of their injures</purpose> <condition>should they later exhibit symptoms consistent with Havana syndrome or report being victims of a health episode</condition>.
<S>The measure</S><V>comes</V><condition>as some intelligence officers have expressed reticence about accepting foreign posts, or bringing their family members on tours in countries where the episodes have taken place</condition>, <S>current and former officials</S><V>said</V>. "<S>I</S><V>think</V><condition>as long as these incidents are recurring, with what seems to be increasing frequency, without the identification of a perpetrator and without the ability to stop them</condition>, <S>I</S><V>think</V><effect>those concerns are going to continue</effect>," <S>said Representative Adam B.</S>
<S>Schiff</S>, <S>Democrat of California</S> and <S>the chairman of the Intelligence Committee</S>.
<S>A U.S. official</S> <V>said</V> <O>C.I.A. officers had volunteered in large numbers to work on the issue of the health episodes</O>, <manner>eager to find answers</manner>.
<time>Since 2016</time>, <S>diplomats, intelligence officers and military personnel in Asia, Europe and the Americas</S> <V>have reported hearing strange sounds, feeling unexplained heat or experiencing pressure</V> <effect>and then suffering headaches, nausea, vertigo or other symptoms</effect>.
<S>the symptoms</S><V>have gone on</V><effect>for months or years</effect>.
<S>some government officials</S><V>are convinced</V><cause>that a hostile intelligence service using an eavesdropping device or a directed-energy weapon is responsible for the injuries</cause>, <S>C.I.A. analysts</S><V>have not reached a conclusion</V><O>about what is causing the episodes or if a hostile power is responsible</O>.
<S>the agency's director</S>, <S>William J.</S>
<S>Burns</S><V>has been praised</V><purpose>for the attention and resources he has put toward victims of Havana syndrome</purpose>, <S>Congress</S><V>has been critical</V><manner>of how the C.I.A. and the larger U.S. government handled the cases before this year</manner>.
<S>The Intelligence Committee</S><V>is doing</V><O>its own investigation</O>, <S>and the bill approved on Thursday</S><V>mandates</V><O>an inspector general review of the performance of the C.I.A.'s medical division</O>, <S>and</S><V>sets up</V><O>an outside advisory board to examine its work</O>. "<S>We</S><V>want</V><O>accountability</O>," <S>Mr. Schiff</S><V>said</V>. "<S>It</S><V>took</V><O>too long to get to where we are</O>.
<S>The Biden administration</S> <V>published</V> <O>new guidelines</O> <time>on Thursday</time> <purpose>for which undocumented immigrants should be prioritized for arrest</purpose>, <effect>giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents broad discretion to decide who poses threats to public safety and national security</effect>.
<S>The priorities</S> <V>are intended</V> <purpose>to further undo the broad immigration arrest policies of the Trump administration</purpose>, <purpose>and to instead direct immigration officers to focus on each person rather than categories of specific offenses</purpose>. <S>"The fact that an individual is a removable noncitizen</S> <V>should not alone be the basis</V> <effect>of an enforcement action against them</effect>," <S>Alejandro N.</S>
<S>Mayorkas</S>, <S>the secretary of homeland security</S>, <V>said</V> <time>on Thursday</time>. "<S>we</S> <V>are requiring</V> <purpose>and, frankly, empowering our work force — critically, empowering our work force — to exercise their judgment, their law enforcement judgment</purpose>." <S>Such considerations</S> <V>include</V> <O>the seriousness of a past offense</O>, <O>what kind of harm it caused</O> <O>and whether a firearm was involved</O>.
<S>agents</S> <V>should also consider</V> <O>"advanced or tender age"</O> <purpose>as a mitigating factor</purpose>.
<S>Other considerations</S> <V>include</V> <effect>the effect that arresting and eventually deporting someone would have on the person's family</effect>.
<S>some immigration advocates</S> <V>think</V> <O>the guidelines</O> <effect>give agents too much discretion without a clear plan for accountability</effect>.
<S>The guidelines</S><V>come</V><time>as Democrats appear to be losing a fight</time><purpose>to include a path to citizenship for millions of unauthorized and temporarily authorized immigrants</purpose><place>in a sprawling budget reconciliation bill</place>.
<S>The new arrest priorities</S><V>would largely exclude</V><O>the noncitizens</O><purpose>to whom lawmakers had hoped to extend permanent residency</purpose>, <place>including young adults who arrived in the country as children</place>, <place>as well as farm and health care workers</place>.
<S>There</S> <V>are</V> <O>11 million noncitizens</O> <place>in the country</place> — <S>some</S> <V>with temporary authorization</V> <purpose>to live and work</purpose>, <concession>but many without any documentation at all</concession> — <S>and</S> <V>limited resources</V> <purpose>to enforce the law</purpose>.
<S>President Donald J.</S><V>administration</V><time>Early in his</time>
<S>Trump</S> <V>rejected</V> <O>the prosecutorial discretion</O> <S>his predecessor</S> <V>put in place</V> <place>on immigration enforcement</place> <S>and</S> <V>instead set out</V> <purpose>to arrest any noncitizen in the country without authorization</purpose>, <purpose>speed deportations</purpose> <S>and</S> <V>enlist local law enforcement more often</V> <purpose>to act as immigration enforcers</purpose>.
<S>Mr. Trump's first press secretary, Sean Spicer</S><V>said</V><O>the president wanted to "take the shackles" off Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents</O>, <effect>which some agents at the time said was a welcome change</effect>.
<S>Lena Graber</S>, <S>a senior staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center</S>, <V>said</V> <S>she</S> <V>worried</V> <effect>that the guidelines gave officers so much discretion that enforcement actions would not look much different from those during the Trump administration</effect>.
<S>Representative Cori Bush</S>, <S>a Democrat from Missouri</S>, <V>is known</V> <place>on Capitol Hill</place> <manner>as a nurse, a pastor, a Black Lives Matter activist and a member of a "squad" of progressive women lawmakers</manner>.
<time>On Thursday</time>, <S>she</S> <V>told</V> <O>a House panel</O> <S>that she</S> <V>is</V> <O>also a rape survivor</O> <S>who</S> <V>had</V> <O>an abortion</O> <time>after she was attacked on a church trip</time> <time>when she was 17</time>.
<S>Ms. Bush</S><V>said</V><S>she</S><V>is</V><O>no longer ashamed</O>. "<time>In the summer of 1994</time>," <S>she</S><V>declared</V>, "<S>I</S><V>was raped</V>, <S>I</S><V>became</V><O>pregnant</O> <S>and I</S><V>chose</V><O>to have an abortion</O>." <cause>With the right to abortion under threat after a major Supreme Court setback</cause>, <S>Ms. Bush</S><V>was</V><O>one of three Democratic congresswomen who sat at a witness table to share their personal experiences with terminating a pregnancy</O>.
<S>The hearing</S> <V>reflected</V> <O>a sharp cultural divide</O>, <manner>with Republicans accusing Democrats of "glorifying and normalizing" abortion</manner>, <manner>and Democrats making their point — that abortion is a decision best left to women and their doctors — in matter-of-fact terms</manner>.
<S>Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington</S><V>got</V><O>an abortion</O><time>when she was a young mother</time><manner>caring for a very sick child and struggling to recover from postpartum depression</manner><effect>so severe that she considered suicide</effect>.
<S>Her doctor</S><V>told</V><O>her</O><effect>that carrying a second child to term would be extremely risky for both her and the baby</effect>. <S>"I</S><V>very much wanted</V><purpose>to have more children</purpose>," <S>she</S><V>told</V><O>the panel</O>, <S>"but I</S><V>simply could not imagine</V><purpose>going through that again</purpose>." <S>Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California</S>, <V>was</V><O>the first Black cheerleader in her high school</O> <S>and</S> <O>a promising student with good grades</O><time>when she got pregnant before abortion was legal in the United States</time>.
<S>Her mother</S><V>sent</V><O>her</O><place>to a friend in Texas</place>, <S>who</S><V>took</V><O>her</O><manner>"back alley" abortion</manner><place>at a clinic in Mexico</place>. <S>"A lot of girls and women in my generation</S><V>didn't make it — they died</V><cause>from unsafe abortions"</cause>, <S>she</S><V>said</V>.
<S>Representative Kat Cammack</S>, <S>a freshman from Florida and the lone Republican member of Congress to testify</S>, <V>offered</V> <O>a starkly different personal story</O>, <V>telling</V> <O>her colleagues</O> <S>that she "would not be here"</S> <condition>if her mother, who suffered a stroke after having her first child, had not rebuffed a doctor's advice to have an abortion</condition>. <S>"You can imagine the feeling, the disappointment, the struggle, the internal anguish that my mother felt,"</S> <S>Ms.Cammack</S> <V>said</V>, <V>adding</V>, <S>"She chose life."</S>

<S>Trump</S><V>blasted</V><O>President Biden's tenure</O><time>During a keynote address in Orlando, Fla., that lasted an hour and a half — and began more than an hour late</time> — <place>to the friendly Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC</place>, <effect>so far</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>called</V> <O>it</O> <place>"the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history"</place> <S><V>hit</V> <O>Biden</O> <place>on many fronts — from immigration to national security to Biden's coronavirus pandemic response</place>.
<S>The main thrust of Trump's criticism</S><V>was</V><place>on immigration policy</place>.
<S>He</S> <V>claimed</V> <O>Biden was "eliminating our [southern] border," triggering "a massive flood of illegal immigration"</O> <effect>that was letting criminals pour out onto U.S. streets</effect>.
<S>It</S><V>was similar</V><O>to the dark and nativist anti-immigration vision</O><cause>that helped launch Trump to political prominence in the first place</cause>,<time>from his 2015 presidential campaign announcement</time>.
<S>Trump</S><V>called on</V><O>Biden</O><purpose>to reopen schools</purpose>, <S>which</S><V>closed down</V><time>during Trump's tenure</time><cause>due to the pandemic</cause>, <S>Trump</S><V>said</V><O>that Biden "caved to the teachers unions."</O> "They're cheating the next generation of Americans <O>out of the future that they deserve, and they do deserve this future</O>," <S>Trump</S><V>said</V>.

<S>The former president</S><V>did not save</V><O>his ire</O><manner>exclusively for his successor</manner>.
<S>He</S><V>maintained</V><O>the false conspiracy theory</O><effect>that he actually won the 2020 election</effect>, <S>he</S><V>blasted</V><O>the court</O><concession>despite picking three of the Supreme Court's current members</concession>, <S>he</S><V>said</V><effect>the justices should be "ashamed."</effect> <S>Trump</S><V>said</V><effect>he would not be starting a third party</effect>.

<S>Black women workers</S><V>are being forced out</V><O>of the workforce</O><effect>in record numbers</effect>, <S>so many Black small businesses</S><V>are being forced to close</V><O>their doors</O>,<S>Harris</S><V>said</V>.
<S>Harris</S> <V>drew</V> <O>a throughline</O> <cause>from those she called "innovators" in the civil rights struggle "who were clear-eyed about the moment in which they lived"</cause> <purpose>to taking action on the pandemic</purpose>. <S>"I do believe we can meet this moment and I do believe that this Black History Month, this year, and at this moment, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges in front of us,"</S> <V>Harris said</V>.
<S>The remarks</S><V>came</V><time>less than 24 hours after the House passed its version of the relief package</time><purpose>with provisions aimed at bolstering the nation's vaccination campaign, stimulating the economy and providing aid from checks to rental assistance to individual Americans</purpose>.

<S>The White House</S><V>announced</V><O>a series of sanctions</O><time>on Friday night</time><cause>for its forced landing of a Ryanair commercial flight and the subsequent removal and arrest of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich</cause>.
<S>White House press secretary Jen Psaki</S><V>called</V><O>the country's action</O> "a direct affront to international norms." <time>The Sunday flight diversion</time>, <manner>made under the false pretense of a bomb being onboard the aircraft</manner>, <time>comes as the government of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko faces growing outcry from the West for the nation's recent crackdowns on free speech and public dissent</time>.

<time>During widespread anti-government protests last year</time>, <S>Protasevich</S> <V>became</V> <O>a key figure among opposition activists</O>, <manner>utilizing the encrypted messaging app Telegram to organize demonstrations</manner>.
<S>Lukashenko</S>, <S>a six-term authoritarian</S> <V>whose most recent election win was marred</V> <cause>by accusations of ballot rigging</cause>, <V>has fashioned himself</V> <manner>as an international strongman</manner> <effect>and is often referred to as Europe's last dictator</effect>.

<S>The White House</S> <V>confirmed</V> <time>Friday</time> <S><V>won't grant</V> <O>former President Donald Trump executive privilege</O> <place>over the first trove of documents</place> <cause>that have been requested by the select congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack</cause>.</S>
<S>The Jan. 6 committee</S><V>is ramping up</V><O>its investigation</O><purpose>into rioters breaching the U.S.</purpose>
<S>Capitol</S><V>to overturn</V><O>the 2020 presidential election</O><purpose>and stop the certification of President Joe Biden's victory</purpose>.
<S>The panel</S><V>has requested</V><O>documents</O> – <S><V>and demanded</V><O>subpoenas</O><condition>in some cases</condition> – <place>from a range of executive branch agencies and members of Trump's inner circle</place><purpose>to try and piece together what the former president and administration knew leading up to and on Jan. 6</purpose>.
<S>Trump</S> <V>claims</V> <O>executive privilege can shield them from the subpoenas and document requests</O>, <time>including the ones to the National Archives and Records Administration which houses communications records at the White House</time>.
<S>White House press secretary Jen Psaki</S> <V>said</V> <time>Friday</time> <place>that Biden wouldn't assert executive privilege over the first batch of documents</place>, <concession>though she didn't rule it out over future ones</concession>. "<S>As a part of this process</S>, <S>the president</S> <V>has determined</V> <place>that an assertion of executive privilege is not warranted for the first set of documents from the Trump White House that have been provided to us from the National Archives</place>," <S>Psaki</S> <V>said</V> <time>at Friday's press briefing</time>. "<S>As we've said previously</S>, <place>this will be an ongoing process and this is just the first set of documents</place>." "<S>And we</S> <V>will evaluate questions of privilege</V> <manner>on a case by case basis</manner>, <concession>but the president has also been clear that he believes it to be of the utmost importance for both Congress and the American people to have a complete understanding of the events of that day to prevent them from happening again</concession>," <S>she</S> <V>added</V>.
<S>The two requests</S> <V>sent</V> <O>to the National Archives</O> <time>from members of Congress in March and August</time> <V>are</V> <manner>sweeping</manner> <effect>and most notably ask for documents and communications on Jan. 6 related to Trump himself, former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's adult sons and daughter, former chief of staff Mark Meadows and other close advisers and allies</effect>.
<S>Trump</S> <V>fiercely pushed back</V>, <S><V>saying</V> <S>he</S> <V>sent</V> <O>his own letter</O> <time>Friday</time> <place>to the National Archives</place> <purpose>arguing he has executive privilege rights over a few dozen of the requested documents</purpose>.

<time>By Thursday morning</time>, <S>the parties</S> <V>clinched</V> <O>a deal</O> <purpose>to lift the country's borrowing limit by $480 billion</purpose>.
<S>Democrats</S> <V>initially pushed</V> <purpose>for raising the cap through 2022</purpose> <concession>but Republicans wouldn't sign off</concession> <S><V>and blocked</V> <O>the measure</O> <effect>twice</effect>.

<S>Democrats</S> <V>are expected</V> <effect>to get the 10 Republicans they need to join them to move toward final passage</effect>.
<S>Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota</S><V>told</V><O>reporters</O><time>prior to the votes</time><S><V>there will be</V><O>10 Republicans voting to break the filibuster</O>.

<S>Thursday's deal</S><V>momentarily breaks</V><O>an impasse</O><place>on an issue</place><cause>that has been politically fraught for years</cause>.
<S>party leaders</S> <V>will be back</V> <place>in the same position</place> <time>since Republicans don't intend to help Democrats break more filibusters on a longer-term measure</time>.

<S>Americans</S><V>view</V><O>the Republican Party</O><manner>by significant margins</manner><effect>as better than the Democratic Party on two key issues: protecting the nation from international threats and ensuring the nation's economic prosperity</effect>,<S><V>a new poll found</V>.
<S>More than half of Americans, 54%</S><V>believe</V><effect>that the GOP will do a better job than the Democratic Party at protecting the nation from international terrorism and military threats in the next few years</effect>, <cause>according to a Gallup survey released Wednesday</cause>, <concession>while just 39% believe the Democratic Party is better suited to do so</concession>.
<S>About 50% of Americans</S><V>believe</V><effect>that the Republican Party will do a better job at keeping the country prosperous</effect>, <concession>while 41% believe the same about Democrats</concession>.
<S>The two GOP advantages</S><V>mark</V><O>the largest gaps</O><time>in more than five years</time>.
<S>The survey</S><V>comes</V><time>after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan</time>, <cause>which Americans generally supported in theory, but not in the "chaotic and deadly way in which it was executed,"</cause> <S>an earlier Gallup poll</S><V>notes</V>.
<S>The polling</S> <V>also came</V> <time>amid a weaker than expected employment report</time>, <cause>and surging coronavirus infections</cause>.
<S>Americans</S> <V>are nearly split</V> <O>on which party can better handle the issues</O>, <condition>when it comes to what Americans deem to be the most important problem facing the country</condition>, <effect>most commonly the coronavirus and the handling of the government itself</effect>, <manner>with 41% believing the Republican Party can do so</manner>, <manner>and 38% the Democratic Party</manner>.
<S>those who listed the coronavirus as the top issue facing the country</S><V>widely say</V><O>the Democratic Party is more equipped to handle it</O>, <concession>while those who said the government is the top issue</concession> <V>are more inclined</V> <effect>to believe the Republican Party is better suited to handle the situation</effect>.
<S>Another Gallup poll released Tuesday</S><V>found</V><effect>that Americans view both major parties negatively</effect>, <concession>and although the two parties are near parity in terms of favorability among the public</concession>, <effect>the Democratic Party's favorability has fallen from elevated levels shortly after President Joe Biden took office in January</effect>, <effect>while the Republican Party's favorability has seen a modest climb</effect>.

<S>Biden</S> <V>said</V>, <S>they</S> <V>don't want</V> <purpose>to pay the check by raising the debt ceiling</purpose>.
<S>Raising the debt ceiling</S><V>does not permit</V><O>any future spending</O>.

<S>Those consequences</S> – <place>detailed also in an independent Moody's Analytics report</place> – <V>include</V> <O>increased unemployment</O>, <O>higher mortgage and credit card interest rates</O>, <O>and the holdup of payments such as Social Security and veterans benefits</O>. <S>"What they're doing</S>" <V>is</V> <O>reckless and dangerous in my view</O>, <S>Biden</S> <V>added</V>, <S>saying the impact</S> <V>could hit</V> <O>U.S. consumers</O> <time>as early as this week</time>.
<S>Raising the debt ceiling</S><V>was</V><effect>once a pro-forma and bipartisan vote</effect>.

<S>The reality</S> <V>is</V> <manner>more complicated</manner>: <S>Senate Democrats</S> <V>can't pass</V> <O>anything</O> <condition>when the GOP threatens to filibuster</condition> – <effect>meaning a supermajority of 60 votes would be required for passage</effect>.
<S>The only way for Democrats</S> <V>to get</V> <O>an increase in the debt ceiling</O> <V>to pass</V> <purpose>is to do it through a complicated process called budget reconciliation</purpose>.
<S>That measure</S><V>cannot be filibustered</V><concession>but also takes weeks to do</concession>, <cause>given how many amendments and votes are involved in the behemoth bill</cause>.

<S>An academic study</S><V>published</V><time>a year before Mr. Biden became president</time><V>was used</V><purpose>to speculate that he would place limits on how much red meat Americans can consume as part of his stated goal to sharply reduce greenhouse gas pollution</purpose>.
<S>It</S> <V>was</V> <O>a potentially potent, visceral argument with punchy cable TV octane</O>, <manner>namely that Mr. Biden was trying to limit people to eating one hamburger a month</manner> – <effect>an allegation that could seriously undermine his climate change plan before he even announced it</effect>.

<S>J.B Pritzker's mask mandate for schools</S><V>was made</V><manner>by falsely contending</manner><O>the results of a Danish study last year</O><effect>dismissed the efficacy of face coverings</effect><manner>by concluding</manner><effect>there was "no statistical advantage to those who wore masks."</effect> <S>The Democratic governor</S><time>on Wednesday</time><V>ordered</V><effect>that masks be worn by all school personnel — teachers, staff and students</effect><cause>due to a rapid increase in cases largely attributed to the delta variant of COVID-19</cause>.

<S>Rabine</S><V>joined</V><O>in the criticism</O>, <manner>saying it was "an unnecessary abuse of power."</manner> <concession>But Rabine went further</concession>, <manner>contending a Danish study in 2020 found that people who wore masks "were just as likely to get COVID-19 as those who didn't."</manner> <S>Rabine</S><V>said</V> <effect>the study concluded there was "no statistical advantage to those who work masks."</effect> <S>Rabine's conclusion</S><V>conflicts</V><O>with context provided by authors of the report</O> <S>who</S><V>said</V> <effect>the study of 6,000 people was geared to look at a 50% difference in COVID-19 infections between those who wore masks and those who did not</effect>.
<S>the authors</S><V>emphasized</V><effect>that their results "should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections</effect>,<cause>because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection</cause>." <S>Source control</S> <V>means</V> <O>the spread of mask wearers to others</O>, <S>meaning the study</S> <V>only assessed</V> <O>the personal protective effect of a mask from being infected</O>, <S>not the potential for masks</S> <V>to block</V> <O>the spread to others</O>, <S>FactCheck.org</S> <V>noted</V>.

<S>The discussion</S><V>comes</V><time>after years of public outcry and demands</time><purpose>that imagery with ties to slavery be removed from public spaces</purpose>. "<S>This</S><V>isn't just about politics</V>, <S>it</S><V>about people connecting their own lives and identities to these stories, these myths or these histories</V>," <S>Smithsonian curator Aaron Bryant</S><V>said</V>.

<S>Bryant</S>, <place>a museum curator at the National Museum of African American History & Culture</place>, <V>also chaired</V> <place>a similar review commission in Baltimore</place>, <S><V>which voted</V> <purpose>to remove a handful of Confederate statues</purpose>.

<S>Bryant</S> <V>said</V> <O>a total erasure of these monuments paints an inaccurate portrait of history</O>.

<S>Democrats who dominate the state Assembly and Senate</S><V>have approved</V><O>bills</O><purpose>with the nursing-home spending mandate</purpose>, <S>aides to the governor and Legislature</S> <V>said</V> <time>Wednesday</time> <S>they</S> <V>were close</V> <effect>to a final agreement</effect>.
<S>The discussions</S> <V>are</V> <effect>a stark shift from last year</effect>, <time>when lawmakers waived regulations and granted broad civil and criminal immunity to healthcare providers</time> <cause>as the state faced a deadly surge in coronavirus cases</cause>.
<S>More than 50,000 New Yorkers</S><V>have died</V><cause>from the Covid-19 pandemic</cause>, <S>and roughly a third</S><V>were residents</V><place>of long-term-care facilities</place>.
<S>The new law</S><V>would also be</V><effect>another response to criticism over how the state handled Covid-19 in nursing homes</effect>.
<S>State Attorney General Letitia James</S><V>issued</V><O>a report</O><time>in January</time><S><V>saying</V><O>the Cuomo administration understated the coronavirus death toll attributed to some nursing homes by roughly 50%</O>.
<S>Legislators</S><V>have already approved</V><O>a bill</O><purpose>to repeal the immunity provisions</purpose>, <S><V>were adopted</V><time>as part of last year's state budget</time>, <S><V>passed</V><O>a measure</O><purpose>that requires nursing-home operators to disclose more information about their business relationships</purpose>.
<S>Assemblyman Richard Gottfried</S>, <place>a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the chamber's health committee</place>, <V>sponsored</V> <O>bills</O> <purpose>calling for disclosure and mandating that 70% of a nursing home's revenue is spent on patient care</purpose>.
<S>He</S> <V>said</V> <O>it would lead to better care</O>, <place>particularly at for-profit facilities</place>. "<S>Certainly</S>, <V>the Covid-19 situation has shined</V> <O>a bright light on nursing home issues</O>," <S>Mr. Gottfried</S> <V>said</V> <place>in an interview</place>. "<S>These issues</S> <V>were all very pressing</V> <time>for the last several decades</time>, <concession>but sometimes it takes a calamity to energize people to action</concession>." <S>Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union</S>, <place>which represents 65,000 workers in about half of the state's nursing homes</place>, <V>is campaigning hard</V> <purpose>for the disclosure and spending measures</purpose>.
<S>Nursing homes and their representatives</S><V>said</V><O>the spending mandate</O><effect>would impose more financial restrictions on an industry that was devastated by the pandemic</effect>.
<S>President Biden</S> <V>unveiled</V> <O>a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan</O> <purpose>centered on fixing roads and bridges, expanding broadband internet access and boosting funding for research and development</purpose>, <purpose>plus higher corporate taxes to pay for the package</purpose>. <S>"It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"</S> <S>Mr. Biden</S> <V>said</V> <time>during a speech in Pittsburgh</time>, <place>where he kicked off his presidential campaign</place>. <S>"It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America."</S> <S>The Democratic president</S> <V>cast</V> <O>his plan</O> <purpose>as a fundamental shift in economic thought away from the small-government, tax-cutting approach embraced decades ago under Ronald Reagan, a Republican</purpose>. <S>"Here's the truth: We all will do better when we all do well,"</S> <S>Mr. Biden</S> <V>said</V>, <cause>arguing that the pandemic had exposed longstanding inequalities in the country</cause>. <S>"It's time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle up, not the top down."</S> <S>He</S> <V>said</V> <S>his plan</S> <V>isn't</V> <O>an attack on wealthy Americans</O>. <S>"This is not to target those who've made it, not to seek retribution,"</S> <S>he</S> <V>said</V>. <S>"This is about opening opportunities for everybody else."</S> <S>The president's advisers</S> <V>say</V> <cause>the Covid-19 pandemic has helped change American attitudes about the role government should play in their lives</cause>, <effect>making political space for unprecedented investments that could reshape the country</effect>.
<S>The measure</S><V>comes</V><time>after Mr. Biden signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill into law</time>, <S>it</S><V>is</V><O>the first of a two-part economic plan</O><purpose>that he hopes to move through Congress in coming months</purpose>.
<S>A second plan</S><V>focused</V><place>on child care, healthcare and education</place><V>will be released</V><time>in April</time>.
<S>Mr. Biden's economic proposals</S><V>are expected to cost</V><O>between $3 trillion and $4 trillion</O><time>over a decade</time>, <cause>according to people involved in the discussions</cause>.
<S>Mr. Biden's infrastructure proposal</S><V>faces hurdles</V>, <cause>including GOP opposition to significant tax increases</cause>, <cause>disagreements among Democrats about how to pay for the package</cause> and <cause>progressives' concerns that it isn't ambitious enough</cause>.
<S>The infrastructure plan</S><V>would cost</V><O>roughly $2.3 trillion</O><time>over eight years</time><S><V>and be paid for</V><time>over 15 years</time><S><V>by raising</V><O>the corporate tax rate</O><effect>to 28% from 21%</effect><S><V>and increasing</V><O>taxes on companies' foreign earnings</O>.
<S>The tax changes</S><V>would revamp or replace</V><O>much of the international tax structure</O><S><V>established</V><time>four years ago</time><place>in the law</place><S>congressional Republicans</S><S><V>signed</V><S>then-President Donald Trump</S>.
<S>Mr. Biden's proposal</S><V>includes</V><O>$621 billion to modernize transportation infrastructure</O>, <O>$400 billion to help care for the aging and those with disabilities</O>, <O>$300 billion to boost the manufacturing industry</O>, <O>$213 billion on retrofitting and building affordable housing</O> and <O>$100 billion to expand broadband access</O>, <place>among other investments</place>.
<S>Democratic House candidate Rita Hart</S> <V>said</V> <S>she</S> <V>was dropping</V> <O>the challenge</O> <place>to her narrow election loss in Iowa</place>, <time>after her effort drew increasing concern among Democrats on Capitol Hill</time>.

<S>She</S> <V>blamed</V> <O>a "toxic campaign of political disinformation" around her challenge</O>, <concession>while also wishing Ms. Miller-Meeks well in the post</concession>.
<S>The House Administration Committee</S><V>opted</V><manner>on party lines</manner><time>earlier in March</time><purpose>to review the contest</purpose>.
<S>It</S> <V>isn't unusual</V> <purpose>for candidates to appeal to the House to review a race's results under the Federal Contested Elections Act</purpose>, <concession>but such efforts rarely succeed</concession>.
<S>the process</S> <V>had continued</V>, <S>it</S> <V>could have resulted</V> <effect>in a vote by the full House on the matter</effect>.
<S>Ms. Hart's challenge</S><V>had quickly turned into</V><O>a high-octane political fight</O><manner>with which Democrats, particularly those in competitive districts, were becoming increasingly uncomfortable</manner>.
<S>Some Democrats</S><V>were</V><manner>both privately and publicly</manner><V>expressing</V><O>concern</O><place>over having to vote on the result of the state-certified election in Iowa</place>,<time>after having objected to earlier efforts by GOP lawmakers to overturn President Donald Trump's election defeat</time>.

<S>Union leaders and Democratic state lawmakers</S> <V>made</V> <O>a final push</O> <time>Monday</time> <purpose>to increase taxes on the wealthy</purpose> <place>as part of a roughly $200 billion state budget</place> <time>due this week</time>.
<S>Gov.</S>
<S>Andrew Cuomo</S><V>hasn't yet discussed</V><O>taxes</O><place>with leaders of the Democrat-controlled state Assembly and Senate</place>, <S>people familiar with the budget negotiations</S><V>said</V><time>Monday</time>.
<S>top aides for the executive and legislative branches</S> <V>spoke</V> <time>throughout the weekend</time> <place>about both revenue and spending programs</place>, <S>officials</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>The people</S> <V>said</V> <S>lawmakers</S> <V>are settling</V> <O>on their plans for spending programs</O> <time>before deciding on a tax package</time>.
<S>Mr. Cuomo</S><V>included</V><O>a $1.5 billion income tax increase</O><time>when he proposed a $193 billion budget in January</time>.
<S>Leaders of the Senate and Assembly</S> <V>each proposed</V> <purpose>raising more than $6.5 billion of revenue</purpose> <manner>by increasing income taxes, corporate taxes, the state's estate tax and placing a 1% surcharge on income derived from capital gains</manner>.
<S>The Senate and Assembly plans</S><V>would each spend</V><effect>more than $200 billion</effect>.
<S>aides to Mr. Cuomo</S> <V>have rejected</V> <O>proposals</O> <purpose>to increase the estate tax or levy a new surcharge on capital gains</purpose>, <S>the people</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>Under current New York law</S>, <S>capital gains</S> <V>are taxed</V> <manner>at the same rate as wage income</manner>.
<S>discussions</S><V>are ongoing</V><purpose>about hiking the corporate and income-tax rates for the state's top earners</purpose>, <S>the people</S><V>said</V>.
<S>The state's current fiscal year</S> <V>ends</V> <time>on March 31</time>, <time>the legal deadline for a new budget to be in place</time>.
<S>Freeman Klopott</S>, <S>a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo's budget office</S>, <V>said</V> <O>all issues were under discussion</O>. "<S>We</S> <V>have been working</V> <O>with the legislature</O> <time>around the clock</time> <purpose>to deliver a budget that supports New Yorkers in need and sets the state on a course to reimagine, rebuild and renew New York</purpose>, <condition>as we move beyond the pandemic</condition>," <S>Mr. Klopott</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>Wealthy people</S><V>account for</V><O>most of the state's income tax base</O>: <S>The highest-earning 5% of filers</S><V>account for</V><O>more than 60% of the revenue</O><effect>that is raised</effect>.
<S>Mr. Cuomo</S><V>has questioned</V><O>the need to raise taxes</O>, <manner>pointing to the latest federal coronavirus relief bill</manner>—<effect>which provided $12.5 billion in direct aid to the state and billions more dedicated for health and education programs</effect>.
<S>Business executives</S> <V>warned</V> <time>last week</time> <effect>that increasing taxes to the level proposed by legislators would discourage people working remotely outside New York because of the pandemic from returning to the state</effect>.
<S>Propaganda officials</S><V>quietly celebrated</V><place>in Beijing</place><time>two days after a Chinese social-media post helped ignite a frenzy of outrage against Western clothing brands</time>, <cause>according to people familiar with the matter</cause>, <manner>in what they saw as a victory</manner><purpose>in a new effort to inoculate China against criticisms from the West</purpose>.

<S>China</S> <V>fanned</V> <O>the flames</O> <time>the next day</time> <manner>through state-media outlets and Communist Party-affiliated social-media accounts</manner>.
<S>The campaign</S><V>came</V><place>as Beijing draws lessons from what it considers a successful fight with the West over another hot-button issue, Hong Kong</place>.
<S>Officials from China's Foreign Ministry and the Communist Party's Propaganda Department</S><V>raised</V><O>the example of Hong Kong</O>, <S><V>talked</V><O>about the need to push back on Xinjiang</O><cause>as international attention has shifted to the Uyghurs</cause></S>, <concession>according to people briefed on the proceedings</concession>.
<S>Beijing authorities</S><V>initially censored</V><O>the news</O><time>After pro-democracy protests broke out in Hong Kong in 2019</time><place>on the Chinese internet</place><effect>before reversing course and promoting protest images as evidence of an alleged plot by Western powers to destabilize China</effect>.
<S>The Communist Party</S><V>has since cemented</V><O>its grip on the former British colony</O>, <V>winning</V><O>support at home</O><concession>despite opposition from Western governments</concession>.
<S>As officials</S> <V>discussed</V> <manner>responding in a similar manner</manner> <place>on Xinjiang</place>, <S>the topic of cotton</S> <V>came up</V>, <S>two of the people familiar with the matter</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>The possibility</S> <V>of pressuring foreign companies with business interests in China to advance Beijing's interests</V> <effect>was also discussed</effect>.
<S>Some scholars present at the meeting</S><V>argued</V><S><V>needed</V><O>to loudly refute every false story or statement about Xinjiang</O>,<S>the people</S><V>said</V>.
<S>Other scholars and political advisers</S><V>suggested</V><S>China</S><V>should respond</V><manner>reasonably and with legal evidence</manner><condition>if foreign companies published "improper statements" on Xinjiang</condition>, <concession>but</concession> <S>that pressure</S> <V>should come</V> <place>from the public and industry</place>, <concession>not the government</concession>.

<S>The TAKE with Rick Klein</S><V>Amid searing and sometimes chaotic events</V>, <S>the story out of the White House of late</S><V>has been</V><O>what President Joe Biden isn't saying as much as what he is</O>.
<time>Last week</time>, <S>it</S> <V>was</V> <O>what the president wasn't saying publicly</O> <place>about bloody clashes in the Middle East</place>.

<S>The bully pulpit</S><V>was quiet</V>, <manner>with a paper statement from Biden praising "the good-faith efforts from Democrats and Republicans to pass a meaningful bill out of the Senate."</manner> <S>The White House</S> <V>is characterizing</V> <O>his approach</O> <purpose>as a way to give Capitol Hill negotiating space</purpose>.
<S>it</S> <V>rankles</V> <O>some</O> <place>on both the left and the right</place> <purpose>-- for different, though related, reasons</purpose>.
<S>Republican senators</S><V>are not-too-subtly suggesting</V><effect>that Biden's team is going back on the president's private words to them</effect>, <cause>per ABC News' Trish Turner and Allison Pecorin</cause>. <S>"The president</S><V>will not be surprised</V><effect>at the more outlined and specific offer that he is going to receive"</effect>, <S>Sen.</S>

<S>Some of what is making the Biden presidency notable</S><V>is</V><O>its contrasts to what came before it</O>.
<S>Diplomacy</S> <V>is</V> <manner>diplomatic</manner> <S>and putting real faith in Congress to work toward solutions -- not to mention staying out of the immediate news cycle --</S> <V>are just part</V> <O>of what makes normal feel abnormal</O>.
<S>Bridgett Floyd</S><V>publicly pushed</V><O>Biden</O><purpose>to work harder to get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed</purpose>. <S>"I</S><V>was going</V><O>to D.C.</O><purpose>for Biden to sign a bill</purpose>, <S>Biden</S><V>has not signed</V><O>that bill</O>, <S>Biden</S><V>broke</V><O>a promise</O>," <S>Bridgett Floyd</S><V>said</V><place>during a rally in Minneapolis</place>.

<S>Several progressive legal groups and independent judicial watchdogs</S><V>criticized</V><O>the optics</O>. <S>"If Justice Barrett wants the Supreme Court not to be seen as partisan, she should avoid being hosted by a center named after the most partisan person in America,"</S> <V>said</V> <S>Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix The Court, a nonpartisan advocacy group</S>. <S>"There's value in members of the high court speaking to audiences outside of Washington, but that concept is corrupted when stretched to rationalize appearing at events that look and sound like political pep rallies."</S> <S>Breyer</S> <V>was not asked about</V> <O>and did not comment on the connection with McConnell</O>.

<S>Owner Harris Turner and president Jon Greenberg of the American Hockey League's Milwaukee Admirals, Nashville's top minor league affiliate</S><V>lauded</V><O>Prokop</O><purpose>for his decision</purpose>.

<S>A funny thing</S> <V>happened</V> <place>on the way to the Phoenix Suns winning their first NBA title</place>.
<S>Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks</S><V>woke up</V><effect>after falling into a 2-0 deficit</effect>, <S><V>reeled off</V><O>four straight wins</O></S>, <purpose>for their first NBA championship since 1971</purpose>.
<S>It</S> <V>is not</V> <cause>that the Suns were that bad</cause>, <concession>but the Bucks were that good</concession>.

<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>not just a victory for Antetokounmpo</O>, <S>who</S> <V>had</V> <O>an all-time memorable game with 50 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks</O> <time>in the Game 6 clincher on Tuesday night</time>.
<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>a victory</O><place>for small-market teams</place><effect>who can't put together a squad with four superstars as easily as the bigger markets can</effect>.
<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>a victory for patience for sports teams</O>, <S>which</S><V>seems to wither away</V><time>every season</time><S><V>a favored team doesn't win</V><O>a championship</O>.
<S>The Bucks</S> <V>reached</V> <O>the conference finals</O> <time>in 2019</time> <S>and</S> <V>fell</V> <O>in a surprising second-round upset</O> <time>last season</time> — <manner>with Antetokounmpo winning the regular-season MVP both years</manner> — <S>and</S> <V>they didn't panic</V>.
<S>General manager Jon Horst and the rest of the front office</S><V>deserve</V><O>a ton of credit</O><purpose>for making the necessary changes</purpose>, <purpose>including paying a premium price for Jrue Holiday this season</purpose>, <purpose>to put the right pieces around Antetokounmpo</purpose>.
<S>It</S><V>is not easy</V><effect>to stay the course</effect> — <concession>with Antetokounmpo potentially eyeing an exit for greener pastures if things didn't work out</concession> — <V>and getting it right</V>.
<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>a victory for Antetokounmpo</O>, <S>who</S><V>didn't feel the need</V><purpose>to jump ship on the team that took a chance on him, and the city that embraced him</purpose>, <purpose>to go chasing championships in bigger markets</purpose>.
<S>The Finals MVP</S><V>chose</V><O>his own path</O>,<concession>and Tuesday night's superb performance</concession><V>puts</V><O>him</O><place>in a higher echelon with some of the game's best</place>.
<S>That the Bucks were able to get by the craftily constructed Brooklyn Nets by the smallest of margins — whatever the measure of Kevin Durant's foot on the 3-point line —</S><V>isn't lost</V><place>in this discussion</place>.
<S>It</S> <V>takes</V> <O>a bit of luck</O> <purpose>to win a title</purpose>, <concession>but they had to get themselves there</concession>.
<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>a victory</O><place>for Khris Middleton</place>, <S>who</S><V>isn't just the player</V><place>the Pistons gave up on too early</place>.
<S>He</S> <V>showed up</V> <place>on the big stage</place> <S>and</S> <V>played</V> <O>his part</O> <manner>perfectly</manner>, <purpose>complementing Antetokounmpo</purpose> <S>and</S> <V>making</V> <O>a name for himself</O> <effect>as one of the better players in the league</effect>.

<S>Carroll</S> <V>has</V> <O>a reigning state champion in Century</O>, <S>which</S> <V>went</V> <effect>15-4 in 2019</effect> <S>and</S> <V>blanked</V> <O>La Plata 1-0 in the Class 2A final</O>.
<S>The Knights' offense</S><V>lost</V><O>a combined 35 goals</O><cause>from first-team all-county standouts Jackson Glenn, Alex Grasso, and Kyle Kropfelder</cause>.
<S>Senior Kyle Hatmaker and sophomore Cooper Santos</S><V>are</V><O>two offensive players</O><purpose>tasked with filling the void</purpose>.
<S>Liberty (11-2-1)</S>, <S>the reigning Carroll County Athletic League champion</S>, <V>returns</V> <O>a pair of first-team all-countians</O> <place>in defender Michael Pellicciotti and midfielder Ben Hiebler</place>.
<S>Both</S> <V>factored in</V> <O>the Lions' season-opening win</O> <time>Tuesday</time> <place>against Westminster (5-8-2)</place>.
<S>Pellicciotti and Hiebler</S><V>are</V><effect>the only returning all-county first-teamers around Carroll</effect>.
<S>Manchester Valley (9-6)</S><V>has</V><O>a new coach in John Woodley</O>, <S>the Mavericks</S><V>won</V><O>their opener against Century</O><time>on Tuesday</time>.
<S>South Carroll (8-5-1)</S><V>graduated</V><O>the reigning Player of the Year in forward Carter Chesney</O>, <S>the Cavaliers</S><V>tied</V><O>Winters Mill (6-9)</O><time>in their opener</time>.
<S>The result</S> <V>worked out</V> <effect>for Tra Evans</effect>, <concession>but he wasn't happy</concession>.
<S>The Atholton cornerback</S><V>didn't play</V><O>the pass</O><manner>correctly</manner>, <concession>but Wilde Lake's receiver couldn't haul in what would have been the game-winning touchdown</concession><time>late in Friday's season-opening contest</time>. "<S>It</S> <V>was</V> <effect>enough</effect>," <S>said Atholton's John Prajka</S> <V>to Evans</V><time>after the play</time>. "<S>That's</S> <V>all that matters</V>." <S>Atholton coach Eric Woodson</S> <V>echoed the same sentiment</V><time>after his team's 7-6 victory over the Wildecats</time>.
<S>The Raiders</S><V>didn't score</V><O>an offensive touchdown</O>, <V>threw</V><O>two interceptions</O> <effect>and muffed a punt</effect>.
<S>it</S> <V>was</V> <effect>enough to win</effect>. "<S>We</S> <V>take</V> <O>it</O> <manner>anyway we can</manner> <V>and move on</V>," <S>Woodson</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>The Raiders' lone touchdown</S><V>was</V><O>an 18-yard interception return from cornerback Jerome Colbert</O><time>in the third quarter</time>.
<S>Wilde Lake quarterback Kofi Boampong</S> <V>rolled out</V> <place>to his left</place> <V>and threw</V> <O>an errant pass</O> <place>right to Colbert</place>, <S>who</S> <V>sprinted</V> <manner>untouched</manner> <place>into the end zone</place>. <S>"That was huge," Woodson</S> <V>said</V>. <S>"That's when the tide turned for us."</S> <concession>While Atholton's offense didn't score</concession>, <S>the Raiders</S> <V>did dictate</V> <O>the flow of the game</O> <cause>thanks to 5-foot-11, 230-pound running back Dillan Watkins</cause>.
<S>The bruising junior</S><V>totaled</V><O>105 yards</O><manner>on 23 carries</manner>. "<S>We</S><V>controlled</V><O>the clock</O>," <S>Woodson</S><V>said</V>. "<S>He</S><V>is</V><effect>a very powerful runner</effect>."
<S>We've got</S><V>about four backs</V>, <S>but I</S><V>featured</V><O>him</O><time>tonight</time>.
<S>he</S><V>'s</V><effect>that big back at 230 [pounds] who can carry the load</effect>." <S>The win</S><V>is</V><O>Atholton's first over Wilde Lake</O><time>since 2017</time>, <time>and six months ago</time>, <S>the Raiders</S><V>lost</V><O>26-0 to the Wildecats</O>. "<S>It</S><V>feels great</V><purpose>to get this win, first time in five seasons</purpose>," <S>Colbert</S><V>said</V>.
<S>Wilde Lake (0-1)</S><V>started off</V><O>the home contest</O><manner>with something it did often last season</manner> — <V>intercepting</V><O>the opposing quarterback</O>.
<S>Watkins</S><V>barreled</V><O>Atholton (1-0)</O><place>down the field</place><time>before quarterback Harrison Feldman</time>,<S>who</S><V>split time</V><O>with Miles Scott</O>,<V>was intercepted</V><O>by Wilde Lake cornerback Max Richardson</O><place>in the red zone</place>.
<S>Feldman</S><V>was picked off</V><O>again</O><place>on Atholton's next drive</place>, <manner>this time</manner> <S><V>by sophomore safety Nazir Fell</V>.
<S>The Cats' offense</S><V>couldn't capitalize</V><O>on either mistake</O>, <concession>though</concession>, <cause>as both drives stalled out</cause>. <S>"There are no excuses, but we're a young squad," Henderson</S> <V>said</V>. <S>"We've got to learn</S> <V>how to take advantage</V>.
<S>This</S> <V>is</V> <O>a learning experience</O>, <S>and we'll</S> <V>push forward</V> <time>to next week</time>." <time>After a scoreless first half</time>, <S>Colbert's pick-six</S> <V>was</V> <O>the first touchdown of the game</O>.
<S>The interception</S><V>was</V><O>the first of Colbert's varsity career</O>.
<S>"Freak"</S> <V>is a term thrown around</V> <effect>too much in the sports world</effect>, <concession>but sometimes</concession>, <S>it</S> <V>is the first phrase that crowds the cranium</V> <time>when a gaudy athletic feat takes place</time>.

<S>The Georgia Bulldogs</S><V>are on their way</V><effect>to yet another SEC Championship Game appearance</effect><S><V>following</V><O>a 41 to 17 win over the SEC East</O> and <V>have</V><O>a legitimate chance</O><purpose>to finish the season with an undefeated record</purpose>.
<S>There</S> <V>are</V> <O>various reasons</O> <purpose>for their dominance in the 2021 season</purpose>, <concession>but one person has gone under the radar to this point</concession>.
<S>Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken</S><V>is quietly building</V><O>a reputation</O><effect>as one of the best offensive coaches in college football</effect>.
<S>Georgia</S><V>has been without</V><O>several key players</O><place>on the offensive side of the ball</place><time>throughout this season</time>,<concession>yet Monken continues to put together masterpieces</concession>.
<S>The Bulldogs</S><V>are averaging</V><O>38.7 points per game</O><concession>despite missing their opening day starting quarterback, several high-quality skill position players, and a few key offensive linemen at points this year</concession>.
<S>Georgia's offense</S><V>continues to find ways</V><O>to move the ball and score</O><concession>No matter who is in the game</concession>.
<S>Georgia</S><V>has scored</V><O>30+ points</O><place>in every game</place><time>since their week one victory over the Clemson Tigers</time>.
<S>Monken</S> <V>deserves</V> <O>a lot of credit</O> <manner>for how they seamlessly move from week to week</manner>.
<S>He</S> <V>plays</V> <purpose>to the team's strengths</purpose> <S><V>ensures</V> <O>that they force players to improve</O> <time>with every game</time>.
<S>Monken</S> <V>has continually protected</V> <O>the deficiencies on his roster</O> <concession>whether it's injury or a weakpoint</concession>.
<S>He's</S><V>protected</V><O>an offensive line</O><effect>that's seen two starters in Tate Ratledge and Jamaree Salyer miss time at points this season</effect><manner>and hasn't played with a tremendous amount of consistency</manner>.
<S>He's</S><V>protected</V><O>a quarterback</O><concession>that even though has played well</concession>,<effect>has physical limitations at the position</effect>,<manner>all while preparing a second quarterback in JT Daniels to play</manner><manner>with a completely different gameplan</manner>.
<S>It</S><V>'s been a balancing act</V><time>all season</time><place>for Monken</place>.
<S>Good coordinators</S> <V>can call</V> <O>productive offense</O> <place>within the confines of their system</place>, <concession>but great ones adapt to their personnel</concession>.
<S>Monken</S> <V>is forced</V> <effect>to adapt week after week</effect> <cause>because of the injury bug plaguing this Georgia football team</cause>.
<S>Sources around the program</S> <V>raved</V> <effect>about Monken's work ethic and attention to detail</effect> <time>over the offseason</time>, <S>and that</S> <V>has rung true</V> <time>during the regular season</time>.
<S>He</S><V>has gone through</V><O>two starting quarterbacks</O>, <O>a surplus of starting wide receivers</O>, <O>and a rotating cast of offensive linemen</O>.
<time>This weekend</time>, <S>the Jets</S> <V>were</V> <place>in Green Bay</place> <purpose>to take on the Packers</purpose> <time>in their second dress rehearsal</time> <time>as the regular season approaches</time>.
<S>Rookies</S> <V>saw</V> <O>plenty of action</O> <time>in Saturday's game</time>, <S>and they</S> <V>will play</V> <O>a huge role</O> <place>on this very young football team</place>.
<S>Coach Saleh</S><V>said</V><time>before the game</time><S><V>that</V><O>six to nine rookies are going to play a lot</O>,<S><V>and</V><O>several of them could potentially even start</O>.
<S>First-round offensive guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, and second-round receiver Elijah Moore</S> <V>did not suit up</V> <place>in Green Bay</place> <cause>due to nagging injuries</cause>, <S>but let's</S> <V>break down</V> <purpose>how the rest of the rooks looked in their first trips to Lambeau</purpose>.
<S>The Jets rookie quarterback</S><V>strung together</V><O>another very sharp performance</O><time>in his second taste of preseason action</time>.
<S>Wilson</S><V>played</V><O>the majority of the first half</O><manner>with the first-team offense</manner> and <V>put up</V><O>an impressive statline</O>, <V>completing</V><O>nine of 11 passes</O> <purpose>for 128 yards and two passing touchdowns</purpose>, <manner>with a nearly perfect passer rating of 154.7</manner>.
<S>The only blemish on Wilson's performance</S><V>was</V><O>a ball delivered on the run that was thrown behind an open Corey Davis</O>.
<S>Zach</S> <V>bounced back</V> <time>on the next two plays</time>; <concession>however</concession>, <V>converting</V> <O>a third and short</O> <manner>and then delivering a gorgeous ball on the run</manner> <place>about 30 yards down the sideline</place> <O>to Davis</O>.
<S>Wilson</S><V>ended up capping</V><O>the drive</O><manner>off with an 18-yard touchdown strike</manner><place>over the middle</place><purpose>to his tight end Tyler Kroft</purpose>.
<S>Other noteworthy Wilson plays</S> <V>included</V> <O>a 24-yard strike to Davis</O> <place>between two defensive backs</place> <time>on the first drive of the game</time> <S>and</S> <V>a second 18-yard touchdown pass to Kroft</V>.
<S>The rookie</S><V>has done</V><O>a great job</O><manner>of quickly getting the ball out of his hands</manner>,<effect>as he has yet to take a sack this preseason</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>has done</V> <O>so</O> <manner>without forcing the ball</manner> <S>and</S> <V>has done</V> <O>a fine job</O> <purpose>of checking the ball down when he needs to</purpose>.
<S>Zach</S> <V>has looked</V> <manner>very poised</manner> <place>in the pocket</place>, <S>there</S> <V>do not appear</V> <effect>to be any jitters with him</effect>, <S>and his timing with receivers</S> <V>has been</V> <manner>pretty much spot on</manner>.
<S>the Jets' new quarterback</S> <V>certainly looks like he belongs</V> <time>through two games of preseason football</time>.
<S>The Jets' fourth-rounder</S><V>figures to play</V><O>a role</O><place>in a very crowded backfield</place><time>this season</time>, <S><V>and he has shown</V><O>some promise</O><time>early on this preseason</time>.

<S>Now</S>, <V>it's time</V> <purpose>for the in-season adjustments to begin</purpose>.
<S>Adjustments</S> <V>are</V> <effect>a huge part of the NFL game</effect>, <S>week-to-week tweaks</S> <V>can mean</V> <effect>the difference between a promising campaign and a successful one</effect>.

<S>Arizona</S> <V>is leaning</V> <place>on a two-back system featuring Chase Edmonds and James Conner</place>.
<S>Conner</S><V>out-rushed</V><O>Edmonds</O><time>in Week 1</time>, <S>Edmonds</S><V>was</V><effect>clearly the more explosive runner</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>averaged</V> <effect>a full two yards per carry more (5.3 versus 3.3)</effect> <O>than Conner</O>.
<S>There</S> <V>was</V> <effect>actually an even split in touches</effect>, <cause>as Edmonds caught four passes</cause>, <concession>but Arizona should lean more heavily on Edmonds</concession> <condition>until/unless Conner proves he can be just as effective on the ground</condition>.
<S>The Atlanta Falcons</S> <V>got absolutely handled</V> <effect>(32-6)</effect> <cause>by the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 1</cause>.
<S>The defense</S><V>was</V><O>a predictable problem</O>, <effect>which ranked 29th overall in 2020</effect>.
<S>Atlanta's inability</S><V>to produce</V><O>points</O><effect>was a shock</effect>.
<S>The Falcons</S><V>traded</V><O>Julio Jones</O><time>in the offseason</time>.
<S>They</S> <V>also don't have</V> <O>a proven workhorse running back</O>.
<S>They</S> <V>do have</V> <O>weapons like Hayden Hurst, Calvin Ridley and rookie fourth overall pick Kyle Pitts</O>, <concession>though</concession>.
<S>Atlanta's inability to find the end zone</S><V>rests</V><cause>on the offensive game plan of new head coach Arthur Smith</cause>.
<S>Smith</S><V>tried</V><manner>to lean on the run</manner>,<purpose>allowing it to open up big plays in the passing game</purpose>—<concession>the same strategy he employed with the Tennessee Titans</concession>.
<time>In the lone NFL preseason game Thursday night</time>, <S>there</S> <V>were</V> <effect>very few starter-vs.-starter battles</effect>, <S>the Philadelphia Eagles' starting quarterback</S> <V>was scratched</V> <cause>due to an illness prior to kickoff</cause>, <S>that team</S> <V>failed</V> <effect>to score a point</effect>, <S>there</S> <V>were</V> <effect>several potentially serious injuries</effect> <S>and we</S> <V>had</V> <effect>a blowout on our hands from the jump</effect>.
<S>that</S> <V>doesn't mean</V> <S>we</S> <V>didn't learn</V> <O>a lot</O> <manner>as the Eagles stumbled their way through</manner> <effect>a 35-0 loss to the New England Patriots</effect>.
<S>Here</S> <V>are</V> <O>five takeaways</O> <time>from the maiden matchup in Week 2 of the NFL preseason</time>.
<S>veteran quarterback Cam Newton</S><V>looked smooth</V><time>while running the New England offense</time><time>For the second successive week</time>.
<S>He</S> <V>was</V> <manner>particularly crisp</manner> <time>when it came to moving the ball underneath</time>, <concession>but he was also 3-for-3 on passes that traveled 10-plus yards</concession>, <cause>according to Pro Football Focus</cause>.
<S>The potential problem</S><V>for Newton</V>?
<S>Rookie first-round pick Mac Jones</S><V>threw</V><O>the ball</O><effect>better than Newton down the field last Thursday</effect>, <S>he</S><V>looked like a veteran</V><place>in the pocket</place> <S>and a rocket launcher</S><V>on deep and intermediate passes</V>.
<S>The Athletic's Jeff Howe</S><V>pointed out</V>, <S>the Alabama product</S><V>was 13 of 19 for 146 yards</V><effect>but with three drops and a spike accounting for four of those six incompletions</effect>.
<S>N'Keal Harry</S> <V>had pulled in</V> <O>this dime</O>?
<S>Bill Belichick</S> <V>may have</V> <O>some thinking</O> <condition>unless a lot changes in the team's final preseason game</condition>.
<S>The team's actions this offseason</S> <V>indicate</V> <effect>they're all in for 2021</effect>, <S>it</S> <V>would be a shame</V> <effect>to let Jones waste away on the sideline</effect> <condition>when he looks stellar and they could have used that first-round pick on an impact player elsewhere</condition>.
<S>Newton</S> <V>has</V> <O>an MVP on his resume</O>.
<S>He</S><V>has got</V><O>star power</O>, <S>it</S><V>is entirely possible</V><S>he</S><V>is getting</V><O>his groove back</O><time>after several disappointing but often unhealthy seasons</time><place>in both Carolina and New England</place>.
<S>Trading Newton now</S> <V>would be</V> <manner>a little too bold</manner>, <S><V>wouldn't make</V> <O>a lot of sense financially</O> <cause>considering he'll make less than $6 million in 2021 without achieving incentives</cause>.
<S>the sample</S> <V>remains small</V> <concession>with Jones, who hasn't faced a lot of starting competition yet</concession>.
<S>The Pats</S><V>should, however, strongly consider</V><O>an approach</O><condition>that is sometimes suggested in similar situations</condition><concession>but almost never put into action</concession>: <manner>Using both quarterbacks situationally</manner><time>throughout the season</time>.
<S>optimism</S><V>is at an all-time high</V><time>With training camps quickly approaching around the NFL—the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers open on July 21</time>—<effect>optimism is at an all-time high</effect>.
<S>Every team</S><V>is undefeated</V>, <S>and</S> <place>under the expanded playoff format</place>, <S>most teams</S> <V>can realistically challenge</V> <purpose>for the postseason</purpose>.
<S>Not every team</S> <V>will be</V> <O>a Super Bowl contender</O>, <concession>of course</concession>, <S>but each franchise</S> <V>has</V> <effect>at least one reason to be hopeful about the coming season</effect>.
<S>Every team</S><V>should be flying high</V><concession>Whether that's a promising new quarterback, the culture change brought on by a new coaching staff, the potential of a strong free-agent class or sheer overall talent</concession>.
<S>we</S><V>will examine</V><O>each franchise's biggest reason for optimism</O><time>heading into training camp</time>.
<S>Teams</S> <V>are listed</V> <manner>in alphabetical order</manner>. <time>2020 Record: 8-8</time> <S>The Arizona Cardinals</S> <V>were close</V> <time>in 2020</time>, <S>and they</S> <V>have</V> <O>the foundation for a stellar offense</O> <place>in quarterback Kyler Murray</place>.
<S>The Oklahoma product</S><V>thrived</V><manner>with new wideout DeAndre Hopkins</manner><time>last season</time>, <V>finishing</V> <effect>with a passer rating of 94.3, 3,971 passing yards, 819 rushing yards and 37 combined touchdowns</effect>.
<S>Arizona's biggest reason for optimism</S><V>is</V><O>its retooled defense</O>.
<S>The Cardinals</S><V>were</V><manner>stealthily</manner> <O>12th in points allowed last year</O>, <S>the defense</S> <V>should be even better</V> <time>in 2021</time>.
<S>Pass-rusher J.J.</S><V>is</V><O>a highly sought-after player</O> in the NFL.
<S>Watt and rookie linebacker Zaven Collins</S><V>highlight</V><O>the new additions</O>.
<S>Arizona</S> <V>also added</V> <O>cornerbacks Darqueze Dennard and Malcolm Butler</O> <place>in free agency</place> <S><V>and drafted</V> <O>defensive backs Marco Wilson, Tay Gowan and James Wiggins</O>.
<S>Arizona</S> <V>should have pass-rusher Chandler Jones back</V> <time>after he missed 11 games in 2020</time>.
<S>He and Watt</S> <V>could emerge</V> <effect>as one of the top pass-rushing duos in the NFL this season</effect>.
<S>The Cardinals</S> <V>can realistically hope</V> <purpose>for a top-10 defense this season</purpose>.
<S>That</S><V>should make</V><O>Arizona a real threat in the NFC</O><cause>, combined with a potent Murray-centric offense</cause>. <time>2020 Record: 4-12</time> <S>The Atlanta Falcons</S><V>traded</V><O>star wideout Julio Jones</O><time>this offseason</time>, <effect>which likely bummed out many fans</effect>.
<S>they</S> <V>also added</V> <O>former Florida tight end Kyle Pitts</O>, <S>who</S> <V>can inject</V> <O>new life</O> <purpose>into the Falcons' potent passing attack</purpose>.
<S>the Falcons</S><V>ranked</V><O>fifth in passing</O><concession>Even with Jones sidelined for seven games in 2020</concession>.
<S>Pitts</S><V>has</V><effect>the potential to create mismatches all over the field</effect>. "<S>Pitts</S><V>has</V><effect>all the makings of being a true matchup nightmare at the TE position with the athleticism, versatility, grit and skill set to play across the formation</effect>," <S>Nate Tice of the B/R Scouting Department</S><V>wrote</V>.
<S>Four of the top seven picks from the 2021 NBA draft</S><V>were in action</V><time>during Day 4 of the Las Vegas Summer League</time>.
<S>it</S><V>is only fair</V><time>after diving deeply into Tuesday's showdown between Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green</time>, <S>we</S><V>spotlight</V><manner>how the rest of the newbies are faring so far</manner>. (<S>All five of the remaining top-seven selections</S><V>were slated to play</V><time>on Wednesday</time>, <cause>but Josh Giddey, the No. 6 pick, was held out of the Oklahoma City Thunder's tilt against the New Orleans Pelicans with a left ankle sprain</cause>.) <purpose>Please, please, pretty please do not interpret these stock reports as referendums on how each top-seven rookie will fare in his inaugural season</purpose>.
<S>This exercise</S> <V>is</V> <effect>instead a mixture of observations based on how they've played in Sin City only</effect>.
<S>Wednesday's performances</S><V>will be</V><O>our primary focus</O>.
<S>previous outings and big-picture discussions</S><V>remain</V><O>part of the calculus</O><concession>Like always, though</concession>.
<S>This party</S><V>will wrap up</V><place>with the "Breakout Candidate of Day 4,"</place><S>a totally real, not-at-all made-up award</S><V>given</V><O>to the player</O><effect>who seems most poised to parlay his summer-league showing into regular-season ascension</effect>.
<S>Some</S> <V>will look</V> <O>at Scottie Barnes' summer league to date</O> <purpose>and use it to troll the Toronto Raptors for not selecting Jalen Suggs at No. 4</purpose>.
<S>Don't be one</S><V>of those people</V>.
<S>Glimpses into what can be</S> <V>are</V> <effect>just as important, just as telltale</effect>, <effect>as sustained excellence in exhibition games</effect>.
<S>Barnes</S><V>is</V><effect>already an extremely active defender</effect>,<S><V>and his comfort within the play-finishing niche and at the foul line should ensure</V><effect>he doesn't non-factor himself off the floor during the regular season</effect>.
<S>there</S> <V>is</V> <effect>an incompleteness to his offense</effect>.
<S>His takeoff points</S> <V>are</V> <place>all over the place</place> <effect>and oft-premature</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>needs</V> <purpose>to better account for the defenders in front him</purpose> <purpose>and use more changes of direction to position himself closer to point-blank range</purpose>.
<S>He</S> <V>is currently forcing</V> <O>too many shots</O> <place>from various spots</place>—<cause>this could just be a symptom of summer league</cause>—<effect>and his misses are misses</effect>.
<S>some of Barnes' makes</S><V>are</V><effect>seductive</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>has</V> <O>the chops</O> <purpose>to bake in more off-the-bounce spins, methodical fades and sudden pull-backs</purpose>.
<S>Raptors fans</S> <V>will cling</V> <effect>to the turnaround jumper he hit over Jonathan Kuminga after faking left—and they absolutely should</effect>.
<S>Toronto</S> <V>should be equally attached</V> <O>to his 1-of-2 clip</O> <place>from deep in the team's Wednesday loss to the Golden State Warriors</place>.
<S>we</S> <V>place</V> <O>waaay too much stock</O> <time>into the NBA offseason</time> <time>during which</time> <S>Las Vegas Summer League performances</S> <V>are</V> <effect>too much</effect>.
<S>I</S><V>am</V><manner>just kidding</manner>.
<S>This</S> <V>is</V> <O>not that type of space</O>.
<S>Not entirely</S><V>anyway</V>.
<S>Our summer league takeaways</S> <V>aim</V> <purpose>to focus on players who will have a legitimate crack at rotation minutes during the regular season</purpose> <concession>but will, for the most part, fall short of forecasting future perennial MVPs and eventual first-ballot Hall of Famers</concession>.
<S>Interpret these observations</S> <V>as</V> <manner>"Hey, look at this!" moments and feats</manner> <concession>rather than exegetic declarations</concession>.
<S>Every summer league note</S><V>will be inspired</V><cause>by the most recent slate of games</cause>, <concession>but hearkening back to previous contests and zooming out for bigger-picture musings</concession><place>remains on the table</place><purpose>as part of the process</purpose>.
<S>Let us</S> <V>now explore</V> <O>the latest batch of Las Vegas standouts</O> <time>before Davion Mitchell forces me to turn them over</time>.
<S>The Memphis Grizzlies</S><V>have been searching</V><O>for a cornerstone wing</O><time>since before Chandler Parsons' face became a yoga mat logo</time>.
<S>It</S> <V>is</V> <O>a quest</O> <effect>that predates even Rudy Gay</effect>, <S><V>one</V> <effect>that feels, even on the most optimistic days, never-ending</effect>.
<S>Desmond Bane's Monday detonation against the Brooklyn Nets</S><V>is</V><condition>a sign of what's to come</condition>, <S>the Grizzlies' search</S><V>may be nearing</V><O>its conclusion</O>...<concession>or at least have a chance to do so</concession>.
<S>Last year's No. 30 pick</S><V>went for</V><O>32 points and four assists</O><manner>on 11-of-19 shooting</manner>,<manner>including a scintillating 6-of-8 clip from beyond the arc</manner>.
<S>His buckets</S><V>were not</V><O>gimme opportunities teed up by others</O>, <concession>either</concession>.
<S>Bane</S><V>dribbled</V><O>into threes</O>, <S><V>hit</V><O>a step-back triple</O><manner>in transition</manner></S> and <S><V>froze</V><O>defenders</O><manner>while attacking at varying speeds</manner></S>.
<S>He</S> <V>even set</V> <O>the table</O> <purpose>for teammates coming over screens</purpose>—<concession>not in a way that suggests higher-power point forward magic</concession>, <manner>but with enough patience and handle</manner> <purpose>to plumb the depth of his ball skills next year</purpose>.
<S>Summer league</S> <V>is</V> <effect>seldom telltale of regular-season roles</effect>.
<S>Bane</S><V>will not be</V><O>the first or second option</O><place>in Memphis</place>.
<S>the Grizzlies</S> <V>voluntarily prioritized</V> <O>their bigger picture</O> <time>when they took on the contracts of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams</time> <effect>and didn't do much of anything during free agency</effect>.
<S>That</S> <V>implies</V> <effect>a willingness to experiment</effect> <time>during the 2021-22 campaign</time>.
<S>And right now</S>, <S>"expanding Bane's offensive role"</S> <V>should top</V> <O>the list of trials they're prepared to run</O>.
<S>Immanuel Quickley</S> <V>showing out</V> <place>in summer league</place> <V>doesn't come</V> <effect>as much of a surprise</effect>.
<S>Knicks Coach Tom Thibodeau</S> <V>is just about out of buttons</V> <effect>to push</effect>.
<S>he</S><V>'s running out</V><O>of time</O><purpose>to find new ones</purpose>.
<time>On Sunday</time>, <place>in Game 4 of their first-round N.B.A. playoff series</place>, <S>his Knicks</S> <V>kept</V> <O>the Atlanta Hawks' elite backcourt tandem of Trae Young and Bogdan Bogdanovic</O> <manner>relatively contained</manner>.
<S>The two players</S> <V>combined</V> <effect>to shoot 40.6 percent from the field</effect>.
<S>Young</S> <V>went</V> <place>to the free-throw line</place> <effect>only five times, four below his season average</effect>.
<S>Thibodeau</S> <V>got</V> <O>the first productive game of the series out of RJ Barrett</O>, <S>who</S> <V>had</V> <O>21 points on 8-of-15 shooting, 6 rebounds and 4 assists</O>.
<S>Thibodeau's midseries adjustment</S><V>continued</V><effect>to play dividends</effect>: <S>Rose</S><V>carried</V><O>the team</O><manner>offensively for stretches</manner>, <S>Gibson</S><V>provided</V><manner>tough defense and rebounding</manner>.
<S>the Knicks</S><V>were still run off</V><place>the court</place><time>in the second half</time>,<V>losing</V>, 113-96.
<S>They</S> <V>are on the brink of elimination</V> <time>heading into Game 5 of the best-of-seven series on Wednesday</time> <place>at Madison Square Garden</place>.
<S>Thibodeau</S> <V>cannot adjust</V> <O>the Knicks out of this</O>: <S>His best player, Julius Randle</S>, <V>has been</V> <effect>a negative on the court</effect>.
<time>On Sunday</time>, <S>Randle</S> <V>had</V> <O>his best game of the series</O> — <concession>and it wasn't very good</concession>: <S>He</S> <V>had</V> <O>23 points</O> <manner>on 7-of-19 shooting</manner>, <manner>along with 10 rebounds and seven assists</manner>.
<S>Six of those points</S> <V>came</V> <time>in the fourth quarter</time> <condition>when the game was well in hand</condition>.
<S>Randle</S><V>shot</V><O>4 of 12</O><time>In the first half</time>, <S><V>continuing</V><effect>a series-long slump</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>looked</V> <effect>more active in spurts throughout the game</effect>, <concession>but he also seemed</concession> <effect>to be late on some close-outs against the Hawks' shooters</effect>.
<S>The Hawks</S><V>won</V><cause>on the strength of their perimeter shooting</cause>, <S>He</S><V>tried</V><purpose>to establish his ailing jump shot early</purpose>.
<S>He</S> <V>missed</V> <O>several step-backs</O>, <effect>which made life more difficult for him at the rim</effect>, <place>where he missed makable layups</place>.
<S>Some of Randle's ineffectiveness</S><V>is</V><cause>because the Hawks have engineered their entire defense to stop him</cause>.
<S>Randle</S> <V>seemed to make</V> <O>an adjustment</O> <time>Sunday</time> <manner>by getting rid of the ball much quicker</manner> <condition>when double teams arrived</condition>."<S>I</S> <V>like</V> <O>a lot of the plays</O> <condition>that Julius made today</condition>," <S>Thibodeau</S> <V>said</V> <time>after the game</time>.

<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>Julius's makeup</O>.
<S>he</S> <V>goes through things</V>, <S>he</S> <V>always gets</V> <effect>better and better</effect>, <S>and that's who he is</S>.
<place>PORTO, Portugal</place> — <S>Another attack</S> <V>had broken down</V>, <S>another minute</S> <V>had passed</V>, <effect>and by now there was just a hint of panic in Kyle Walker's eyes</effect>.
<S>The Champions League title</S><V>was slipping</V><effect>away</effect>.
<S>he</S> <V>did</V> <O>what he has been conditioned to do</O> <time>these past five years</time>.
<S>He</S> <V>turned</V> <place>to the place that always gives him the answers</place>.
<S>Chelsea</S> <V>dallied</V> <O>over taking a goal kick</O>, <purpose>hoping to see a few more precious seconds ebb away as it closed out its victory</purpose>, <S>Walker and Manchester City's coach, Pep Guardiola</S>, <V>held</V> <O>an impromptu summit</O> <place>on the touchline</place>.
<S>It</S> <V>was not hard</V> <effect>to work out the dynamic</effect>.
<S>Walker</S><V>wanted</V><purpose>to know what to do</purpose>.
<S>Guardiola</S><V>had seen</V><O>?</O>
<S>The breach</S><V>was</V><O>in the line</O>?
<S>they</S> <V>did rescue</V> <O>this</O>?
<S>Guardiola</S><V>responded</V><manner>with a torrent of instructions</manner>,<concession>as he always does</concession>.
<S>He</S> <V>is</V> <effect>never short of ideas</effect>.
<S>he</S> <V>passes</V> <O>them</O> <place>on to one or other of his fullbacks — the closest players to him</place> — <S>they</S> <V>diffuse</V> <O>them</O> <place>through the rest of the team</place>.
<S>This time</S>, <V>was</V> <manner>different</manner>.

<S>He</S> <V>could hear</V> <O>the words</O> <effect>coming out, just about, above the din of Chelsea's jubilant fans</effect>.
<S>there</S> <V>was</V> <O>a look of blank incomprehension</O> <place>on his face</place>, <manner>as if Guardiola had accidentally addressed him in Catalan or issued his instructions as a rap</manner>.
<S>Walker</S> <V>furrowed his brow and stared, hard, at his coach</V>, <manner>in a vain attempt</manner> <purpose>to make it all make sense</purpose>.
<S>Walker</S> <V>was back</V> <place>at the touchline</place>, <time>a couple of moments later</time>, <manner>this time with the ball in his hands</manner>.
<S>He</S> <V>took</V> <O>a couple of steps</O>, <S>and then</S> <V>launched</V> <O>it</O> <manner>long, deep</manner> <place>into the penalty area</place>.

<S>he</S> <V>required</V> <O>supplemental oxygen</O><time>Almost immediately</time>, <S>lung exams</S> <V>showed</V> <effect>ominous signs of worsening disease</effect>.
<S>Yates</S>, <S>who is medical director of Jacksonville Health and Rehabilitation</S>, <S>a skilled nursing facility 75 miles northeast of Birmingham</S>, <V>knew</V> <S>his patient</S> <V>needed</V> <O>more powerful interventions</O> — <manner>and fast</manner>.
<S>Yates</S> <V>had placed</V> <O>an order</O> <place>with the Alabama Department of Public Health</place> <purpose>for monoclonal antibodies</purpose>, <place>the lab-made proteins</place> <purpose>that mimic the body's ability to fight the virus</purpose> <time>At the first sign of the man's symptoms</time>.
<S>six days</S> <V>passed</V> <time>before the vials arrived</time>, <effect>nearly missing the window in which the therapy works best to prevent hospitalization and death</effect>. "<S>We</S> <V>have been pushing the limits</V> <cause>because of the time frame you have to go through</cause>," <S>Yates</S> <V>said</V>. "<S>Fortunately</S>, <time>once we got it</time>, <S>he</S> <V>responded</V>." <place>Across the country</place>, <S>medical directors of skilled nursing and long-term care sites</S> <V>say</V> <S>they</S> <V>have been scrambling</V> <purpose>to obtain doses of the potent antibody therapies</purpose> <time>following a change in federal policy</time> <cause>that critics say limits supplies for the vulnerable population of frail and elder residents who remain at highest risk of Covid infection even after vaccination</cause>. "<S>There</S> <V>are people dying</V> <place>in nursing homes right now</place>, <S>and we</S> <V>don't know</V> <condition>whether or not they could have been saved</condition>, <concession>but they didn't have access to the product</concession>," <S>Chad Worz</S>, <S>CEO of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists</S>, <V>said</V>, <S>which</S> <V>represents 1,500 pharmacies</V> <purpose>that serve long-term care sites</purpose>.
<time>Before mid-September</time>, <S>doctors and other providers</S> <V>could order</V> <O>the antibody treatments</O> <manner>directly through drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen</manner> <effect>and receive the doses within 24 to 48 hours</effect>.
<S>early versions of the authorized treatments</S><V>required</V><O>hourlong infusions</O><manner>administered at specialty centers or by trained staff members</manner>,<S>a more recent approach</S><V>allows</V><O>doses</O><manner>to be administered via injections</manner>,<effect>which have been rapidly adopted by drive-through clinics and nursing homes</effect>.
<S>Prompt access to the antibody therapies</S> <V>is essential</V> <cause>because they work by rapidly reducing the amount of the virus in a person's system</cause>, <effect>lowering the chances of serious disease</effect>.
<S>The therapies</S><V>are authorized</V><condition>for infected people who've had symptoms for no more than 10 days</condition>, <concession>but many doctors say they've had best results treating patients by day 5 and no later than day 7</concession>.
<S>use of monoclonal antibody treatments</S><V>exploded</V><time>this summer</time><cause>as the delta variant surged</cause>,<place>particularly in Southern states with low Covid vaccination rates</place><S><V>whose leaders were looking</V><purpose>for alternative — albeit costlier — remedies</purpose>.
<S>A Colorado kidney transplant candidate</S><V>was bumped</V><O>to inactive status</O><cause>for failing to get vaccinated against Covid-19</cause><S><V>has become</V><O>the most public example</O><place>of an argument roiling the country's more than 250 organ transplant centers</place>.
<S>Growing numbers of transplant programs</S> <V>have chosen</V> <effect>to either bar patients who refuse to take the widely available Covid vaccines from receiving transplants or to give them lower priority on crowded organ waitlists</effect> <place>across the country</place>.
<S>Other programs</S><V>say</V><O>they plan no such restrictions</O><time>— for now</time>.
<S>At issue</S> <V>is</V> <condition>whether transplant patients who refuse the jabs</condition> <V>are</V> <effect>not only putting themselves at greater risk for serious illness and death from Covid infections</effect>, <effect>but also squandering scarce organs that could benefit others</effect>.
<S>The argument</S> <V>echoes</V> <O>the demands</O> <condition>that smokers quit cigarettes for six months before they receive lung transplants</condition> <condition>or that addicts refrain from alcohol and drugs before they receive new livers</condition>. <S>"It</S> <V>is</V> <O>a matter of active debate,"</O> <S>said Dr. Deepali Kumar</S>, <S>an expert in transplant infectious diseases at the University of Toronto and president-elect of the American Society of Transplantation</S>. <S>"It's</S> <V>really</V> <O>an individual program decision."</O>

<S>Both she and her donor, Jaimee Fougner, 45, of Peyton, Colorado</S><V>refused</V><O>to get vaccinated</O>, <cause>citing religious objections and uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines</cause>. "<S>I</S><V>have</V><effect>too many questions that remain unanswered at this point</effect>.
<S>Lutali</S> <V>said</V>, "I <V>feel</V> <effect>like I'm being coerced into not being able to wait and see</effect> <effect>and that I have to take the shot</effect> <purpose>if I want this lifesaving transplant</purpose>,"
<S>She</S> <V>said</V> <S>she</S> <V>offered</V> <purpose>to be tested for Covid before the surgery</purpose> <concession>or to sign a waiver absolving the hospital of legal risk for her refusal of a vaccine</concession>. <S>"At what point do you no longer become a partner in your own care</S> <concession>regardless of your own concerns</concession>?" <S>she</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>Kentucky firefighter Jimmy Adams</S><V>saw</V><O>the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic</O><time>when he served as a medic</time><purpose>who helped care for the sick on medical calls amid surging Covid cases</purpose>.
<S>He</S> <V>knew</V> <O>retired firefighters</O> <effect>who died of complications from Covid-19</effect>.
<S>he</S> <V>reasoned</V> <cause>that they were older and likely had underlying health issues</cause>, <effect>making them susceptible to the virus</effect>. "<S>That's</S> <V>how you make peace</V> <O>with those things</O>," <S>said Adams, 51, a lieutenant</S>.
<S>He</S> <V>believed</V> <O>the precautions his department was taking</O> <effect>kept him safe</effect>.
<S>he</S> <V>refused</V> <purpose>to get a Covid vaccine</purpose>.
<S>The reason</S><V>wasn't</V><O>strictly political</O>, <S>he</S><V>said</V>.
<S>He</S> <V>had grown weary</V> <place>of the debate around masks, mitigation, caseloads and vaccines</place>.
<time>In mid-August</time>, <S>both Adams and his wife, Sara</S>, <S>who was fully vaccinated</S>, <V>tested positive</V> <O>for Covid</O>.
<S>She</S> <V>experienced</V> <O>mild symptoms</O>, <concession>however he was hospitalized with bilateral interstitial pneumonia</concession>.

<S>He</S> <V>was</V> <manner>on oxygen</manner> <time>throughout his hospitalization</time>. <S>"I</S> <V>was wrong,"</V> <S>said Adams</S>, <time>several days after leaving the hospital</time>. <S>"I</S> <V>suffered</V> <effect>a lot</effect>.

<S>he</S>, <concession>like many firefighters nationwide</concession>, <V>does not support</V> <O>mandates for Covid vaccines</O>.
<S>Firefighter leadership and the rank and file</S><V>are divided</V><place>over such mandates</place>.
<S>The International Association of Fire Chiefs</S><V>has expressed</V><O>support</O><purpose>for mandatory vaccinations</purpose>.
<S>the International Association of Fire Fighters</S> <V>has said</V> <S>it</S> <V>"strongly" encourages</V> <O>firefighters</O> <purpose>to get vaccinated</purpose>, <concession>but does not think it should be mandated</concession>.
<S>Firefighters</S>, <concession>who more often than not are certified emergency medical providers</concession>, <V>have been</V> <place>on the pandemic's front lines</place> <time>since the beginning</time>.
<S>Officials</S><V>pushed</V><purpose>to ensure they would be among the first to receive the vaccines</purpose>,<cause>given their role in the medical system</cause>.
<S>so many who are trained to save lives</S><V>still refuse</V><O>to get vaccinated</O><concession>— while actively fighting against mandates</concession>?
<S>We</S> <V>are</V> <O>pro-vaccine</O>, <S>we</S> <V>are</V> <O>pro-public safety</O>, <concession>but we're just anti-mandate</concession>.

<S>Brian Foster</S><V>was released</V><O>from prison</O><time>nearly a year ago</time><place>under the CARES Act</place>, <S>a government policy</S><V>prioritized</V><manner>the use of home confinement as an appropriate way</manner><purpose>to release some incarcerated people</purpose><cause>as Covid-19 roared through facilities</cause>.
<S>Foster, 54</S><V>returned</V><place>home to Atlanta</place>, <S>the first thing he did</S><V>was surprise</V><O>his mother</O>.

<S>Foster</S> <V>is one of about 4,500 people</V> <place>on home confinement</place> <effect>facing the possibility of being returned to prison</effect> <time>once the pandemic recedes</time>.
<S>The Federal Bureau of Prisons website</S><V>said</V><S>it</S><V>significantly increased</V><O>its placement of offenders on home confinement</O><time>after then-Attorney General William Barr issued a memo in March 2020</time><purpose>directing the bureau to prioritize releasing inmates who were deemed to have especially serious health issues that put them at higher risk for severe illness caused by Covid-19</purpose>.

<S>Dozens of advocacy groups</S><V>have called upon</V><O>President Joe Biden</O><purpose>to exercise his broad presidential powers and commute the inmates' sentences</purpose>.
<S>the administration</S> <V>said</V> <S>its legal team</S> <V>interprets</V> <O>the Trump memo</O> <effect>to mean people will be required to return to prison a month after the official state of emergency for the pandemic ends</effect>.
<S>a BOP spokesman</S><V>said</V><O>the bureau may choose to keep inmates on home confinement post-pandemic if their sentence is nearly over</O><manner>in an email to NBC News</manner>.
<S>the BOP</S><V>is focused right now</V><place>on the expanded criteria for home confinement</place><purpose>and taking steps to ensure individualized review of more inmates who might be transferred</purpose>,<S>the spokesman</S><V>said</V>.

<time>By the time images of desperate Afghans clinging to American warplanes began emerging from Kabul on Monday morning</time>, <S>President Joe Biden</S> <V>had conceded</V> <effect>to aides he had little choice but to interrupt his stay at Camp David to return to the White House</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>had been facing</V> <O>calls</O>, <concession>even from his political allies</concession>, <purpose>to speak out on the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban</purpose>.
<S>His top aides</S><V>had begun publicly admitting</V><O>they were caught off guard by the speed with which the Afghan military would collapse</O><purpose>but wanted the situation in Kabul to stabilize before Biden addressed the nation</purpose>.
<S>his own words</S> <V>from earlier this summer describing</V> <O>a Taliban takeover</O> <effect>as "unlikely" were aggravating the sense of a commander-in-chief caught badly off guard</effect>.
<time>During briefings</time>, <S>the President</S> <V>quizzed</V> <O>his team</O> <purpose>about how they could have misjudged the time it would take for the Afghan army to collapse</purpose>, <manner>according to people familiar with the matter</manner>.
<S>He</S><V>has also voiced</V><O>dismay</O><place>at the failure of Ashraf Ghani</place>,<place>the ousted Afghan president who fled the country on Sunday</place>,<purpose>to adhere to a plan he laid out in the Oval Office in June to prevent the Taliban from taking over major cities</purpose>.
<S>Biden</S><V>had remained</V><place>at the presidential retreat</place><time>throughout the weekend</time>, <V>receiving</V><O>briefings</O><manner>on screens or over the phone</manner><place>while sitting alone at conference table</place>.
<S>Advisers</S> <V>huddled separately</V> <purpose>to discuss when and how he should address the situation</purpose>.
<S>he</S> <V>returned</V> <place>to the White House</place> <time>midday Monday</time>, <S>many of his aides</S> <V>assumed</V> <S>he</S> <V>would at least spend</V> <time>the night</time>.
<S>Biden</S><V>touched down</V><place>in Washington</place>,<time>almost as soon as</time><S><V>word went out</V><effect>that his stay at the executive mansion would be brief</effect>.
<S>Biden</S><V>quickly decamped</V><place>again for the mountains</place><time>After his 18-minute speech</time>.
<S>advisers</S> <V>worked</V> <manner>feverishly</manner> <time>on Monday</time> <purpose>to calibrate the President's speech</purpose>, <S>there</S> <V>was</V> <effect>far less worry about the predictable criticism from Republicans</effect> <concession>than about how Biden's own words and calculations over the last several months had been so wrong</concession>.
<S>The episode</S><V>puts</V><O>into sharp relief two of Biden's most marked political traits</O>: <manner>A stubborn defensive streak</manner> and <manner>a fierce certainty in his decision-making</manner><effect>that allows little room for second-guessing</effect>.
<S>Those traits</S><V>led</V><effect>to an air of defiance hanging over the White House on Monday</effect>, <concession>but remarkable images of the chaos in Kabul</concession> -- <S>which</S> <V>the President called</V> <manner>"gut wrenching"</manner> -- <V>stood</V> <effect>as irrefutable evidence of failure</effect>.

<S>Early data</S> <V>suggests</V> <O>Pfizer's pills, called Paxlovid, are effective against Omicron cases</O>.
<S>The drugmaker</S><V>says</V><S>it</S><V>works</V><purpose>to block the ability of the virus to make copies of itself</purpose>. <S>"This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19,"</S> <S>the FDA's Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni</S> <V>said</V> <time>in a statement on Wednesday</time>.

<S>the drugmaker</S> <V>could seek</V> <O>wider authorization</O> <condition>If it proves safe and effective in those uses</condition> <place>from the FDA</place>.
<S>Paxlovid treatment</S><V>needs</V><O>to begin</O><time>within a few days of first developing symptoms</time>.

<S>Biden</S> <V>later declared</V> <O>a federal emergency for Kentucky</O>, <V>freeing up</V> <O>FEMA assistance and federally subsidized aid</O>, <V>calling</V> <O>the tornado</O> <effect>"an unimaginable tragedy"</effect>. <S>The tornadoes</S> <V>that swept through parts of the Midwest and Tennessee River Valley</V> <time>on Friday night and into early Saturday</time> <V>likely may be recorded</V> <effect>as the worst on record in the United States during December</effect>.
<S>Peak tornado season</S> <V>is</V> <time>usually late spring through early summer</time> <place>in the region</place>.
<S>The tornadoes</S><V>were triggered</V><cause>by a powerful low-pressure system</cause>, <S><V>which lifted</V><place>from the Southern Great Plains into the Great Lakes</place>.
<S>The low-pressure</S><V>intensified</V><cause>as the polar jet stream, the high-altitude current along which storms track, plunged into the central United States ahead of a blast of record-setting warm air</cause>.
<S>The blare of wireless emergency alerts</S><V>was</V><effect>an unusually familiar sound</effect><time>throughout October</time>, <cause>as round after round of damaging tornadic storms tore through towns from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania and North Dakota to Florida</cause>.
<S>October</S> <V>produced</V> <O>record-challenging tornado activity</O>, <effect>impressive not only in number but also in distribution and consistency</effect>.
<S>Five separate outbreaks</S><V>were responsible for</V><O>the near-record 119 twisters confirmed so far</O>, <S>and tornadoes</S><V>were observed</V><time>on 14 days of the month</time>.
<S>The burst of activity</S><V>occurred</V><time>at a time often resistant to vigorous thunderstorm development</time><S><V>is</V><O>a conspicuous statistic</O><place>in a year generally below average in tornadic activity</place>.

<S>It</S> <V>is certainly possible</V> <effect>that the October 2021 number will rise</effect> <time>after all of the month's reports have been evaluated</time>.
<S>Oklahoma</S>, <concession>often a tornado magnet</concession>, <V>more than doubled</V> <O>its October tornado count</O> <time>in 2021</time>.

<S>Just 25 tornadoes</S><V>had occurred</V>.
<S>31 tornadoes</S><V>occurred</V><time>in four days during the month</time>, <effect>more than doubling the yearly count</effect> <effect>and bringing the state close to its annual average</effect>.
<S>tornadoes</S><V>scoured</V><O>the landscape</O><place>across the northern Gulf Coast and Missouri</place>, <place>and as far north as North Dakota and Pennsylvania</place>.
<S>Several tornadoes</S><V>were</V><effect>strong or intense</effect>,<O>rating 2 or 3 on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale for damage</O>.
<S>a remarkable 19 tornadoes</S><V>touched down</V><place>near the border of Ohio and Pennsylvania</place><time>on Oct. 22</time>.
<S>The Weather Service office in Cleveland</S><V>issued</V><O>the most tornado warnings</O><S><V>it had put out</V><O>in one day</O><time>since 2005</time>.

<S>SPACs</S><V>are</V><effect>the investment of the moment</effect>.
<S>This</S> <V>is</V> <effect>a dream scenario for SPACs</effect><cause>with interest rates on the floor and investors chasing young companies</cause>.
<S>investors</S> <V>need</V> <O>to understand these quirky financial concoctions</O> <purpose>to know what's next and how the boom will end</purpose>.
<S>What</S> <V>is</V> <O>a SPAC</O>?
<S>SPAC</S> <V>stands for</V> <O>special-purpose acquisition company</O>, <S>which</S> <V>is</V> <O>Wall Street jargon</O> <place>for a publicly traded company that holds nothing but cash</place>.
<S>SPACs</S><V>exist</V><purpose>to buy private companies</purpose>, <S><V>take</V><O>them</O><manner>public</manner><concession>while avoiding the pitfalls of a traditional initial public offering</concession>.
<S>The hot market</S><V>has drawn in</V><O>Wall Street bankers, tech entrepreneurs and celebrities ranging from Serena Williams to former Cosmopolitan editor Joanna Coles</O>.
<S>SPACs</S> <V>have taken</V> <O>popular companies like sports-betting firm DraftKings Inc. DKNG -3.09% and space-tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. SPCE -4.78%</O> <purpose>public</purpose>.
<S>The SPAC explosion</S> <time>Starting last summer</time>, <S>SPACs</S> <V>began surging</V> <place>onto the stock market</place> <effect>and the momentum continued into this year</effect>.
<S>Now, hundreds of SPACs</S> <V>are doing deals</V> <O>or are on the hunt for companies to buy</O>.
<S>Technology, electric vehicles and green energy</S><V>have been</V><effect>especially hot areas</effect>.
<S>SPACs</S> <V>have been around</V> <time>for decades</time> <concession>but are taking off now</concession> <cause>because the biggest players from Wall Street and Silicon Valley are using them to raise money and take companies public</cause>.
<S>They</S> <V>have raised</V> <O>nearly $95 billion</O> <time>in 2021</time>, <V>soaring</V> <effect>past last year's record total</effect>, <S>and</S> <V>account for</V> <O>about 70% of all IPOs this year</O>, <cause>according to Dealogic</cause>.
<S>How</S> <V>do SPACs work</V>?
<S>A SPAC's "special purpose"</S><V>is</V><purpose>to use the pile of cash it raises in its initial public offering and other funds it takes in to merge with a private company</purpose>.
<S>The private company</S> <V>then gets</V> <O>the SPAC's place</O> <place>in the stock market</place>.
<S>SPACs</S> <V>have</V> <time>two years</time> <purpose>to complete a deal</purpose> <condition>or they must return money to investors</condition>.
<S>Many</S><V>have only needed</V><time>a few months</time><purpose>to announce mergers</purpose>.
<S>Going public via a SPAC</S><V>is appealing</V><cause>because it lets private firms talk up their business</cause>.
<S>It</S> <V>also means</V> <O>their valuation is finalized</O> <manner>with a small group of players behind closed doors</manner> <time>before a deal is announced</time>.
<S>pricing</S> <V>can change</V> <time>until the night before shares start trading</time>.
<place>In the stock market</place>, <S>the SPAC</S> <V>has</V> <O>three lives</O>.
<S>The first</S> <V>comes</V> <time>after the IPO</time>, <time>when the company's only asset typically is $10 in cash per share</time>.
<S>U.S. stocks</S> <V>rose</V> <time>Thursday afternoon</time>, <V>averting</V> <O>a third consecutive day of declines</O>, <cause>as the economic picture continued to brighten</cause>.
<S>The broad S&P 500 index</S><V>fell</V><effect>as much as nearly 1% earlier in the session</effect><S><V>before recouping all of that and more</V>,<V>rising</V><O>20.38 points</O>,<effect>or 0.5%</effect>,<O>to 3909.52</O>.
<S>Stocks closely tied to an economic recovery</S><V>led</V><O>the rebound</O><concession>while shares of technology and other high-growth companies narrowed some of their losses</concession>.
<S>These moves</S><V>helped</V><O>the S&P 500, as well as the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq Composite</O>, <effect>avoid another session of losses</effect>.
<S>Thursday's give-and-take</S><V>was</V><O>the latest episode</O><time>in a volatile stretch of trading over the last month</time><effect>that has sapped major indexes of most of their gains from earlier this year and left the Nasdaq Composite mostly flat since the end of December</effect>.
<S>Signs of a resurgent economy, rising interest rates and nascent inflation</S><V>have spurred</V><O>a massive rotation into so-called value stocks</O><effect>that benefit from an economic rebound—such as manufacturers, banks and retailers</effect>.
<S>investors</S> <V>have been pulling</V> <O>money</O> <place>out of tech companies</place>, <manner>viewing those high-price stocks as particularly vulnerable</manner> <cause>to the shifting economic winds</cause>.
<S>Much of that narrative</S><V>hasn't changed</V><concession>despite the gains major indexes scored on Thursday</concession>, <S>analysts</S> <V>said</V>, <manner>adding that investors should brace for more topsy-turvy sessions</manner>. "<S>We</S> <V>are going to be looking</V> <purpose>for a new narrative</purpose>," <S>Daniel Morris</S>, <place>chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management</place>, <manner>adding that markets will be flat meanwhile</manner>.

<S>Hiring in the United States</S> <V>picked up</V> <time>in May</time> <concession>yet was slowed again</concession> <cause>by the struggles of many companies to find enough workers to keep up with the economy's swift recovery from the pandemic recession</cause>.

<S>The unemployment rate</S><V>fell</V><effect>to 5.8% from 6.1%</effect>.
<S>The speed of the rebound</S><V>has created</V><O>a disconnect between businesses and the unemployed</O><cause>, fueled by substantial federal aid and rising vaccinations</cause>: <condition>While companies are rushing to add workers immediately</condition>, <S>many of the unemployed</S> <V>are still holding back</V>.
<S>Some of the jobless</S><V>are likely seeking</V><O>better positions</O><concession>than they had before the pandemic triggered widespread layoffs</concession>.

<S>a temporary $300-a-week federal unemployment benefit</S><V>has likely led</V><O>many unemployed Americans</O><purpose>to take time to consider their options</purpose>, <place>on top of regular state jobless aid</place>.
<S>That mismatch between employers and job seekers</S><V>resulted</V><effect>in the sharp slowdown in hiring in April</effect>,<time>when businesses added far fewer jobs than economists had forecast and many fewer than had been hired in March</time>.
<S>The disconnect</S><V>eased</V><effect>somewhat in May</effect>.
<S>economists</S> <V>say</V> <S>it</S> <V>will likely persist</V> <time>until early fall</time>, <time>when schools reopen</time>, <effect>COVID-19 fades further</effect> <time>and federal unemployment benefits end</time>. <S>"There is a gap between the economy and labor market,"</S> <V>said</V> <S>Nela Richardson</S>, <S>chief economist at the payroll processing firm ADP</S>.
<S>May's job gains</S>, <S>she</S> <V>said</V>, <effect>are "more lackluster than one would expect given the strong state of economic growth."</effect> <S>The May jobs report</S> <V>offered</V> <O>a number of signs</O> <cause>that companies are trying harder to find workers</cause>.

<S>The company</S><V>has apologized</V><time>after facing social media backlash and accusations of whitewashing congee, exoticizing Asian food and ignoring the dish's Asian roots</time>. <S>"She's stealing our culture but does not honor it,"</S> <V>said</V> <O>Chinese-American writer Frankie Huang</O>.
<S>other companies</S><V>have sold</V><O>variations of congee</O>, <effect>much of the controversy hinges on how the owner of the company, Karen Taylor, claimed to have improved the food</effect>. <S>"I've</S><V>spent</V><O>a lot of time</O><purpose>modernizing it for the Western palette — making a congee that you can eat and find delicious and doesn't seem foreign, but delivers all of the medicinal healing properties of this ancient recipe"</purpose>, <S>Taylor</S><V>said</V><place>in a post on the product's website entitled "How I discovered the miracle of congee and improved it"</place><effect>that has since been deleted</effect>.

<S>She</S> <V>added</V> <effect>that saying an Asian dish must be modernized suggests "Asians are lagging behind the rest of white America, and so apparently it falls on some white woman to save Asian food from Asian people."</effect> <S>She</S> <V>also said</V> <effect>referring to congee as "weird" furthers the exotification of Asian food.</effect> <S>She</S> <V>said</V> <effect>"When you call foods weird, you're accessing a whole history of racist stereotypes that what is white American is normal and normative and everything else is weird or foreign,"</effect>

<S>Singer and actress Bette Midler</S><V>called for</V><O>a sex strike</O><purpose>in response to Texas' highly restrictive new abortion law</purpose>,<manner>stating that women should protest</manner><purpose>until they are given the full right to make their own reproductive decisions</purpose>.
<S>Midler</S> <V>took to Twitter</V> <purpose>to criticize the restrictive new law</purpose>, <S><V>which bans</V> <O>all abortions</O> <time>after a fetal heartbeat has been detected</time> — <effect>effectively prohibiting the procedure after just six weeks of pregnancy</effect> <time>when many women do not yet know they are pregnant</time>. <S>"I suggest</S> <V>that all women refuse</V> <O>to have sex with men</O> <time>until they are guaranteed the right to choose by Congress,"</time> <S>Midler</S> <V>wrote</V> <time>on Thursday</time>.
<S>Midler's comment</S> <V>came</V> <time>after the law went into effect on Wednesday</time>, <time>following a 5-to-4 decision by the Supreme Court</time> <cause>that refused to block the measure</cause>.
<S>The law</S> <V>makes</V> <O>Texas the most restrictive state in the nation</O> <purpose>for accessing abortion services</purpose>.
<S>The law</S><V>was signed</V><O>by Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott</O><time>in May</time>, <S><V>has been widely criticized</V><effect>for undermining Roe v.</effect>
<S>Wade</S>, <S>an abortion rights ruling</S> <V>handed down</V> <time>by the Supreme Court in 1973</time> <effect>that guarantees a woman's right to access abortions without interference from the government</effect>.
<S>the new Texas legislation</S><V>outlaws</V><O>abortions</O><time>once cardiac activity is detected in the embryo</time>, <effect>which typically occurs just six weeks into pregnancy</effect>.
<S>most women</S> <V>do not yet know</V> <O>they are pregnant</O><time>At that early stage</time>, <manner>making the timeframe severely limited</manner> <purpose>to obtain safe abortion services</purpose>.
<S>The ban</S> <V>also applies</V> <place>to cases where a woman is impregnated</place> <cause>as a result of rape or incest</cause> <concession>and only includes an exception for medical emergencies</concession>.
<S>The Center for Reproductive Rights</S><V>states</V><effect>approximately 85-90 percent of people who obtain abortions in Texas are at least six weeks into their pregnancy</effect>.
<S>The new measure</S><V>will likely force</V><O>women who want to obtain abortion services</O><time>after the six-week mark</time><V>to now travel</V><place>across state lines</place>. "<S>most Texans</S><V>will be forced</V><purpose>to travel hundreds of miles out of state for their abortion</purpose>,<condition>if they can afford to do so</condition>," <S>Alexis McGill Johnson</S>, <S>president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America</S>, <V>said</V><place>in a statement</place>. "<S>The harm this law</S><V>will cause</V><effect>will be insurmountable for far too many Texans</effect>,<concession>particularly Black, Latino, Indigenous people, those with low incomes, and Texans in rural areas who already face significant barriers to care</concession>."
<S>It</S> <V>would take</V> <time>weeks</time> <purpose>to fully savor all of Rhode Island's rich Native American history, heritage and culture</purpose>, <concession>but a one-day exploration of prominent places</concession> <V>is</V> <effect>nonetheless rewarding</effect>.
<S>I</S> <V>set off</V> <time>recently</time> <place>on a day trip</place> <condition>that anyone with a vehicle can take</condition>.
<S>I</S> <V>started</V> <place>in Providence</place>, <place>where the rush-hour commute was subsiding as I drove along Dyer Street, across the Providence River from College Hill</place>.
<S>I</S><V>turned off</V><place>at Pine Street</place>, <S><V>parked</V>, <S><V>gazed up</V><place>at "Still Here," a towering mural on a wall of 32 Custom House St.</place>
<S>Commissioned by The Avenue Concept and painted by Baltimore artist Gaia in collaboration with the Tomaquag Museum in Exeter</S><V>"Still Here" depicts</V><O>Narragansett Lynsea Montanari holding a photograph of the late Princess Red Wing (Narragansett/Niantic, Pokanoket)</O>,<purpose>a driving force in the founding of Tomaquag</purpose>.
<S>I</S><V>recalled</V><O>what Tomaquag Executive Director Lorén Spears (Narragansett/Niantic) had told me</O><time>before my tour</time>: "Keep in mind every place is our homeland, <concession>even if the urban sprawl has erased that from the front of people's minds</concession>." <place>From Providence</place>, <S>I</S> <V>drove</V> <place>to Warren</place>, <place>where I visited Burr's Hill Royal Pokanoket Burial Site</place>.
<S>remains of Native Americans, including the great Sachem Massasoit, who died centuries ago</S><V>lie</V><place>beneath grass-covered mounds</place>.
<S>Sachem Tracey Dancing Star Brown and Sagamore William Winds of Thunder Guy (both from Pokanoket Tribe/Pokanoket Nation)</S><V>gave</V><O>me some of the history of the site</O>.
<S>It</S><V>was desecrated</V><time>in the mid-1800s</time><purpose>to build a railroad</purpose>.
<S>A sign</S> <V>summarizes</V> <O>the history</O> <place>of the site on Water Street</place>.
<S>Route 114 South</S><V>brought</V><O>me</O><place>to Newport and Miantanomi Memorial Park</place>.
<S>A steep walk up a hill</S><V>brought</V><O>me</O><place>to a clearing and a World War I memorial</place>.
<time>In the 1600s</time>, <S>the hill</S> <V>was</V> <O>the seat of power</O> <place>for Miantanomi (also sometimes spelled Miantonomo or Miantonomah)</place>, <S>a Narragansett Indian sachem</S>.
<S>Narraganset Bay and the Atlantic Ocean</S><V>were visible</V><place>from the hilltop</place><time>in his time</time>, <concession>but trees have since obscured the view</concession>.
<S>A sea breeze</S><V>cools</V><O>the spot</O>, <S>and benches</S><V>provide</V><O>opportunity for quiet reflection</O>.
<S>I</S> <V>descended</V> <O>the hill</O>, <V>drove</V> <place>across the Pell and Jamestown bridges</place>, <V>and followed</V> <O>Route 1 South to 138 West past the University of Rhode Island to South County Trail, Route 2</O>.
<S>I</S> <V>headed</V> <place>south</place> <S>and</S> <S>about two miles later</S> <V>took</V> <O>a left</O> <place>onto Great Swamp Monument Road</place>.
<S>What</S> <V>do you get</V> <condition>when you combine a businessman, a chef and an artist</condition>?
<S>You</S> <V>get</V> <O>Fox Point's newest restaurant</O>, <place>a tapas bar named Aguardente</place> <purpose>for those seeking out new cultural experiences</purpose>.
<S>The businessman</S><V>is owner</V><O>Victor Pereira</O>.
<time>In 2018</time>, <time>when Syrian refugee Youssef Akhtarin opened</time> <place>the much-acclaimed Aleppo Sweets in Providence</place>, <S>it</S> <V>was</V> <manner>with financial support from Periera and his wife Sandy Martin</manner>.
<S>he</S> <V>opens</V> <O>his own passion project</O> <time>Today, Sept. 22</time> <purpose>to focus on culture, art and of course, good ethnic food</purpose> <manner>with a Rhode Island twist</manner>.
<S>His longtime friends, and now partners</S><V>are</V><O>chef Natalia Paiva-Neves and artist Magda Leon</O>.
<S>Pereira</S><V>said</V><O>Aguardente follows a narrative in his life</O><place>Born in Portugal</place>,
<S>he and his parents</S><V>sought</V><purpose>to assimilate in the United States</purpose>.
<S>He</S> <V>went</V> <O>to college</O> <place>at Boston University</place>, <S>He</S> <V>worked</V> <place>in the retail industry and real estate</place>, <S>He</S> <V>worked</V> <place>in many spots around the world</place>.
<S>What feels important now</S> <V>is</V> <purpose>making sure his heritage is not lost</purpose>.
<S>It</S><V>is time</V><purpose>to hold on to his Portuguese culture</purpose>.
<S>Pereira</S> <V>said</V> <effect>"The best way to do that is with food and spirits, as well as with art"</effect>.
<S>he</S> <V>found</V> <O>like-minded friends</O> <place>In Paiva-Neves and Leon</place>.
<S>The chef</S><V>was born</V><place>in the Azores</place><S>and the artist</S><V>in Guatemala</V>.
<S>They too</S>, <V>believe</V> <purpose>in the importance of holding tight to the cultures of their native lands</purpose>.
<S>Together they've</S><V>created</V><O>a new tapas bar</O>, <manner>cultivating inspiration from their roots</manner>, <manner>and bringing a Rhode Island twist</manner>.
<S>The meaning</S> <V>of Aguardente</V>.
<S>The name Aguardente</S> <V>refers</V> <O>to a Portuguese liquor</O> <effect>which translates into "fire water,"</effect> <S>said Pereira</S>.
<S>Unique imported spirits</S><V>will also star</V><place>on the restaurant's menu</place>.
<S>Paiva-Neves</S><V>curated</V><O>the menu</O>.
<S>her name</S> <V>sounds familiar</V>, <cause>it's because she has run O'Dinis, the Portuguese East Providence restaurant</cause>.
<S>She</S><V>has embraced</V><O>Pereira's concept</O><manner>saying "People are seeking out cultural experiences."</manner> <S>She</S> <V>said</V> <S>she</S> <V>has loved creating</V> <O>the new menu</O>. <S>"It's been great to get my artistic side free flowing,"</S> <V>she said</V> <manner>adding she enjoyed many late nights testing recipes</manner> <place>in her kitchen</place>.
<S>It</S><V>is</V><O>seafood heavy</O><manner>for much of the tapas</manner>.
<S>There</S> <V>are</V> <O>octopus dishes</O> <place>included a cold salad</place> <cause>inspired by her son's love of snail salad</cause>.
<S>A grilled octopus dish</S><V>pairs</V><O>it</O><manner>with garlicky prawns</manner>.
<S>Vegetarian dishes</S> <V>at</V> <place>Aguardente</place>.
<S>Paiva-Neves</S> <V>added</V> <O>an array of vegetarian dishes</O> <time>after sitting with a vegan for one tasting</time>.

<S>it</S> <V>is aiming</V> <purpose>to position itself as a place of vibrancy and possibility</purpose>.

<S>Many pianists — perhaps most</S><V>include</V><O>the music of Chopin</O><place>somewhere in their regular performance repertoire</place>.
<S>there's a separate breed of pianist, the Chopin specialist</S>, <V>who tend to delve</V> <manner>more deeply into this music</manner> <concession>than most</concession>.
<S>I</S> <V>meet</V> <O>people</O> <condition>and they find out what I do for a living</condition>, <S>they</S> <V>usually ask</V> <O>me</O> <effect>how many movies I see in a week</effect>, <S>they</S> <V>ask</V> <O>my favorite movie</O>, <concession>or they ask what I think of their favorite movie</concession>.
<S>Sometimes they'll even comment</S><V>on something</V><O>I wrote recently</O>: "It was good — what was it?
<S>That thing</S><V>you wrote</V>.
<S>What</S><V>was</V><O>it</O>?
<S>somebody</S> <V>comes up</V> <manner>every so often</manner> <time>over the past 12 years</time>, <S>somebody</S> <V>tells</V> <O>me</O> <manner>this</manner>: <S>"I</S> <V>like</V> <O>the obituary you wrote for Brittany Murphy."</O> <effect>That gets my attention</effect>.
<S>I</S> <V>realize</V> <concession>my opinion about me shouldn't count for much</concession> — <S>that</S> <V>was</V> <effect>the best thing I wrote in 2009</effect>.
<S>Murphy</S><V>was</V><O>a young actress</O><effect>who first became widely known</effect><purpose>for co-starring in 1995's "Clueless"</purpose><place>alongside Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd</place>.
<S>She</S> <V>had roles</V> <place>in "Freeway" (1996) and "Girl, Interrupted" (1999)</place>, <time>then peaked in the first years of the millennium</time>, <V>co-starring opposite Eminem</V> <place>in "8 Mile" (2002)</place> <S><V>and with then-boyfriend Ashton Kutcher</V> <place>in the rom-com "Just Married" (2003)</place></S>.
<S>Her last major film</S><V>was</V><O>the 2006 thriller "The Dead Girl,"</O><concession>though she continued working for her remaining three years</concession>.
<S>Her death</S><V>was announced</V><time>on a Sunday before Christmas — Dec. 20, 2009</time> — <purpose>and for the rest of the day</purpose> <S>I</S> <V>just walked around</V> <manner>downcast</manner>.
<S>I</S><V>wasn't</V><effect>particularly a fan</effect>.
<S>I</S><V>hadn't seen</V><O>her</O><place>onscreen</place><time>in two years</time><S><V>and probably hadn't thought</V><O>of her</O><time>in that time</time>.
<S>she</S> <V>had made</V> <O>a warm impression onscreen</O>, <effect>so that when she died it felt like something radiant and distinct had left the world</effect>; <effect>that someone nice, fragile and lovely had just gotten the world's worst break</effect>, <purpose>to be dead at just 32 years old</purpose>.
<S>The impression of niceness she displayed</S><V>is confirmed</V><O>by a new two-part documentary</O><time>that premiered Thursday, Oct. 14</time>,<place>on HBO Max</place>,<place>"What Happened, Brittany Murphy?"</place><S><V>It's a cliche</V><O>that people should not speak ill of the dead</O>,<concession>and yet in common practice, the dead are trashed more than anybody</concession>,<cause>because everybody knows the dead can't retaliate</cause>.
<S>no one</S> <V>has</V> <O>anything bad to say about Murphy</O>, <concession>except in one area: her choice of a husband</concession>.
<S>Murphy's husband, Simon Monjack</S><V>emerges</V><effect>as the villain of the documentary</effect>.
<S>"Venom: Let There Be Carnage," the sequel to 2018's hit comic book movie "Venom,"</S><V>tears up</V><place>the Bay Area</place><manner>with gory glee</manner> — <effect>and that's partially due to new director Andy Serkis</effect>.
<S>The shape-shifting master of computerized performance capture</S><V>is</V><effect>as enthusiastic about dark destruction as he is about his love for San Francisco</effect>.
<S>Serkis</S> <V>recently moved</V> <place>into directing</place> <place>with the English heritage drama "Breathe" and "The Jungle Book" adaptation "Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle."</place> <S>So Serkis</S> <V>felt</V> <effect>more than ready</effect> <time>when "Venom" star and fellow Brit Tom Hardy asked him to direct his second outing in the dual role of Marvel's goopy, toothy symbiote and investigative reporter Eddie Brock, whose body the alien antihero shares</time>.
<S>The production</S> <V>moved</V> <place>to San Francisco</place> <time>for a month's worth of exteriors in early 2020</time> <concession>before the pandemic hit</concession>.
<S>Serkis</S><V>spoke</V><O>with The Chronicle</O><manner>by phone</manner><place>from New York</place><purpose>about the great time he had bringing "Carnage" to the Bay Area</purpose>.
<S>you</S> <V>wanted to distinguish</V> <O>the sequel</O> <concession>from "Venom"</concession>?
<S>The story</S> <V>is</V> <O>that, two years down the line, we're beginning to see an odd-couple relationship blossoming</O>.
<S>It</S> <V>was</V> <effect>a really enjoyable phase of the story arc to come into</effect>.
<S>we</S> <V>tried</V> <purpose>to mine the relationship between Eddie and Venom</purpose>, <S>who</S> <V>can't live</V> <concession>with each other but can't live without each other</concession>.
<S>you</S> <V>got</V> <O>the psychology of Cletus Kasady</O> — <S>the serial killer</S> <V>that</V> <O>Woody Harrelson plays</O> — <concession>but then amplified through Carnage</concession>, <S>the symbiote</S> <V>who comes out of him</V>.
<S>my challenge</S> <V>was</V> <O>to create a movie</O> <effect>that was always going to be a fast-moving roller-coaster ride</effect>, <manner>but with a lot of in-depth character, psychologically and emotionally underpinned</manner>.
<S>Filming</S> <V>was</V> <place>in the Bay Area</place> <O>for you and your crew</O>?
<S>We</S><V>had</V><O>a ball</O>.
<S>We</S> <V>shot</V> <place>there</place> <time>for about three or four weeks</time>.
<S>It</S><V>was</V><O>the last part of the shoot</O>; <S>we</S><V>had been filming</V><place>in the U.K. at Leavesden studios</place>.
<S>President Biden</S> <V>proposed</V> <effect>a 20 percent increase in the budget for the agency to $201 million</effect> <time>on Friday</time> <concession>after four years when the National Endowment for the Arts lived under the threat of elimination</concession>.
<S>it</S> <V>would be</V> <O>the largest increase — in dollar terms — in the organization's history</O>, <S>the agency</S> <V>said</V>.
<S>The proposal</S> <V>is</V> <effect>a sharp turnaround</effect> <time>from the years under President Donald J.</time>
<S>Trump</S><V>proposed</V><O>eliminating funding for the agency</O><time>when, year after year</time>, <S>Trump</S><V>proposed</V><O>eliminating funding</O><place>for the agency, as well as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting</place>, <place>which supports public television and radio outlets around the country</place>.
<S>it</S> <V>must survive</V> <O>congressional scrutiny</O>.
<S>Trump's budgets</S><V>called for</V><O>the elimination of the agency</O><time>every year</time>,<S>its funding</S><V>expanded</V><effect>a bit over the course of his term</effect><cause>as arts advocates leaned on lawmakers to hold the line and save an agency that largely serves as a clearinghouse for grants to arts organizations across the country</cause>. "<S>President Biden's budget</S><V>represents</V><O>a significant commitment to the arts and cultural sector</O><effect>and reflects the continued importance of arts organizations and cultural workers to the health and vitality of the country</effect>," <S>Ann Eilers</S>, <O>the agency's acting chairman</O>, <V>said</V><place>in a statement</place>.
<S>The agency</S><V>said</V> that the <S>"increased investment in the agency</S><V>will allow</V><O>it</O> <purpose>to provide critical support to the arts sector</purpose> <condition>as it struggles to reopen, rehire workers, and generate arts activities</condition> <purpose>that will help fuel the economy</purpose>." <S>The endowment</S> <V>had long been</V> <place>in the cross hairs of Republicans</place> <cause>as a symbol of wasteful liberal largess</cause> <time>when, in 2017, Trump became the first president</time> <purpose>to make a formal proposal to eliminate it</purpose>.
<S>That</S> <V>sparked</V> <manner>active lobbying efforts</manner> <S>by arts advocates</S>, <S>and the agency</S> <V>survived</V> <cause>because of bipartisan support in Congress</cause>.
<S>the agency's budget</S><V>grew</V><effect>by about $17 million to $167.5 million in 2021</effect>.
<S>Biden</S><V>has long been regarded</V><effect>as a consistent advocate for government funding for the arts</effect>.
<S>The American Alliance of Museums</S><V>cheered</V><O>Biden's plan</O>, <S>saying</S> <V>in a statement</V> <S>it</S> <V>was</V> <effect>"a welcome change from the past four years"</effect>. <S>The proposed spending plan</S> <V>is</V> <effect>still tiny compared to the cultural budgets in European countries</effect> <place>where financial support for the arts is viewed as a government function</place>.
<S>Britain's culture ministry</S><V>has annually spent</V><O>more than $1 billion on the arts</O><time>for years</time>.
<S>Cruella de Vil</S> <V>says</V> <effect>"The thing is, I was born brilliant,"</effect> <S>Cruella de Vil</S> <V>says</V> <effect>"Born bad."</effect>
<S>And a little bit mad</S><V>Not quite</V>.
<S>Cruella de Vil</S><V>was</V><O>a married woman with a cat</O><time>In her first incarnation</time>.
<S>Cruella</S><V>was born</V><place>in a 1956 children's novel</place>, "The 101 Dalmatians." <concession>Yes, the skunk hair and selfish nature were there from the start</concession>, <concession>but the original Cruella was more of a spoiled socialite than a Maleficent — at least outwardly — and conveyed a preternatural calm</concession>.
<S>She</S> <V>doused</V> <O>her food</O> <manner>in pepper</manner>, <S>was expelled</S> <cause>from school for drinking ink</cause>, <S>boasted</S> <effect>of having the loudest car horn in London</effect> <S>and</S> <V>was married</V> <O>to a wealthy furrier</O> <concession>— though not for love, apparently</concession>.
<S>She</S><V>wanted</V><effect>unfettered access to as many fabulous fur coats as possible</effect>.
<S>the Cruella character</S><V>has been featured</V><time>Through the years</time>, <place>in a number of adaptations</place>, <place>including two Disney animated films</place>, <place>an animated TV series</place>, <place>two live-action "101 Dalmatians" takes</place> (<place>in which she is portrayed by Glenn Close</place>), <place>a BBC audio drama</place>, <place>a stage musical</place>, <place>a young-adult book series</place> <place>and now the live-action origin story, "Cruella,"</place> <place>with Emma Stone as the title character</place>.
<S>Cruella</S> <V>has gotten</V> <effect>more fabulous, funny and — dare we say it? — likable</effect><concession>, while the Dalmatians have always been a constant</concession>.
<S>Walt Disney</S> <V>found</V> <O>the character</O> <manner>intriguing enough</manner> <purpose>to acquire the rights from Smith for a 1961 animated film</purpose> — <effect>which produced an instantly recognizable theme song</effect>.
<S>Marc Davis</S>,<S>who oversaw the animation of Cruella in "One Hundred and One Dalmatians,"</S> <V>deserves credit</V> <purpose>for creating the on-screen standard</purpose>, <place>from Cruella's disheveled hair and crazed temperament to her unhinged driving and long green cigarette holder</place>, <effect>which was modeled on one of his own</effect>.
<S>He</S> <V>also gave</V> <O>her red lipstick and an exaggerated fur coat with a red lining</O> <concession>(she's a devil, remember?)</concession>, <time>while Bill Peet, who wrote the screenplay</time>, <V>axed</V> <O>her cat and husband</O> <place>from the story</place>.
<S>Disney's version of Cruella</S> <V>has always been</V> <effect>a bit of a feminist fantasy</effect><concession>if you set aside the dognapping and puppy-skinning plots (which are, admittedly, hard to overlook)</concession>.
<S>You</S> <V>know</V> <O>what's chicer than spending a ton on a landmark building</O>?
<S>Spending a ton</S><V>and</V><effect>barely showing it</effect>.
<S>other museums and cultural institutions</S> <V>have turned to</V> <O>Frank Gehry</O>, <S>the Canadian Angeleno and 92-year-old grandmaster of torquing titanium</S> <V>has summoned up</V> <O>buildings both inventive and ostentatious</O>: <place>curves of metal at the Guggenheim Bilbao or Disney Hall in Los Angeles</place>, or <place>billowing sails of glass at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris</place>.
<S>he</S> <V>has left</V> <O>the stainless steel and the kinematics software</O> <place>at home</place> <place>here in Philadelphia</place>, <place>where he was tasked to reimagine one of the country's oldest and most significant museums</place>.
<S>Fifteen whole years</S> <time>after the Philadelphia Museum of Art engaged Gehry for an expansion and renovation of its Beaux-Arts home at the top of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway</time>, <S>the first part of the work</S> <V>is</V> <effect>complete — and discreet</effect>.
<S>His Core Project</S>, <manner>as the museum calls it</manner>, <V>has cleared out and reshaped</V> <place>the underground guts of its Greek Revival home</place> <purpose>to produce 20,000 additional square feet of galleries</purpose>, <place>along with a refreshed entrance and an atrium</place> <purpose>with potential for performances and gatherings</purpose> <time>in post-pandemic days</time>.
<S>It</S><V>cost</V><O>$233 million</O><effect>so far</effect>, <S>and this</S> <V>is</V> <effect>just part one</effect>; <S>next</S> <V>will come</V> <O>additional new galleries underground</O>, <S>and</S> <V>a window puncturing</V> <O>the eastern staircase</O> (<S>you know</S>, <O>the one from "Rocky"</O>).
<S>You</S><V>will see</V><O>Gehry's hushed interventions</O><manner>first via the western entrance</manner> — <concession>which I still think of as the back of the museum</concession>, <concession>although it's been the primary access for years now</concession>. (<place>The eastern entrance, off the parkway and up the steps</place>, <condition>is closed for now</condition>.) <S>It</S> <V>has</V> <manner>more inviting glass doors and proper ramps for wheelchair access</manner>.
<S>The west lobby</S>, <place>called Lenfest Hall</place>, <V>has been given</V> <O>larger windows</O>, <V>and been denuded</V> <O>of the postmodern ticket booths</O> <cause>designed by the museum's previous architects, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown</cause>.
<S>The lobby's east wall</S><V>has been torn down</V>, <S>an auditorium</S><V>has been ripped out</V><purpose>to make way for a new central atrium</purpose>, <manner>clad in the same honey-toned limestone</manner><time>that the museum's initial architects used in 1928</time>.
<S>Here</S> <V>you'll see</V> <O>Gehry's only concession to showiness</O>, <manner>in the form of a Piranesian switchback staircase</manner> <purpose>leading to the basement level</purpose>.
<S>Even that</S> <V>is outshone</V>, <concession>though</concession>, <S>by the splendid vaulted walkway</S> <V>leading off</V> <place>from it</place>, <manner>decked out in Guastavino tile</manner> <S><V>re-emerging</V> <time>after decades</time> <place>as back of house</place>.
<S>Leslie Cuyjet</S><V>has performed</V><O>with dozens of contemporary choreographers</O><time>over the years</time>, <concession>but she's still something of a mystery</concession>.
<S>Her subtle, strong presence</S><V>unassumingly grounds</V><O>the stage</O>
<S>She</S> <V>has</V> <O>a way</O> <manner>of revealing and receding</manner>.
<S>the layers</S><V>are being peeled back</V>: <time>Lately</time>, <S>Cuyjet, 40</S><V>has unveiled</V><O>a potent choreographic voice</O>, <manner>excavating the solo form through video, writing and, of course, the dancing body</manner>. <S>"Blur," a solo that looks at objectification and race</S><V>is set to debut</V><time>on Friday</time><place>at the Shed</place><purpose>as part of its Open Call series</purpose>.
<S>Cuyjet (pronounced SOO-zhay)</S> <V>also has</V> <O>a video piece, "For All Your Life Studies,"</O> <place>in an exhibition called "In Practice: You may go, but this will bring you back," at SculptureCenter in Long Island City</place>.
<S>she</S><V>will appear</V><time>live on June 13</time><place>as part of the Performance Mix Festival in Manhattan</place><S><V>and offer</V><O>a virtual presentation</O><time>on July 11</time><place>for the Center for Performance Research</place>.
<time>Earlier in May</time>, <condition>as part of the Kitchen's Dance and Process series</condition>, <S>she</S> <V>presented</V> <O>"With Marion,"</O> <manner>an elegant, complex look at identity</manner> <cause>partly inspired by Marion Cuyjet, her great-aunt, a pioneering teacher of Black ballet dancers who formed the Judimar School of Dance in Philadelphia in 1948</cause>. <O>"With Marion"</O> <V>seems</V> <effect>to sum up Cuyjet's approach as a choreographer</effect>, <purpose>which is to bring the past into the present through writing and movement</purpose>, <purpose>as well as to surround herself with intimate artifacts</purpose>.
<S>she</S> <V>brought</V> <O>the image of her pandemic studio — a desk — into the space</O> <place>(Queenslab in Ridgewood, Queens)</place>, <S><V>operated</V> <O>a complex system of projections</O> <manner>that included a photograph of her great-aunt</manner>.
<S>Moriah Evans and Yve Laris Cohen</S> <V>were impressed</V> <effect>to pull off something so conceptual and personal</effect>; <S>Moriah Evans and Yve Laris Cohen</S> <V>curate</V> <O>Dance and Process</O>, <place>an incubator that affords choreographers the space and time to develop work</place>.
<S>Evans</S><V>said</V><S>she</S><V>admired</V><O>the nuances of seemingly simple gestures in the piece</O>,<concession>as well as its "delicate shifts,"</concession><S><V>which "contain all the complexity that I think is within Leslie as a person and as a performer: the subtlety, the control, but also the anger, the rage, the freedom."</V><S>Cuyjet's dance lineage and her experience growing up in a middle-class Black family</S><V>are complicated</V><O>for her</O>.
<S>she</S> <V>said</V> <S>she</S> <V>was looking</V> <O>at the privilege afforded by light skin</O> <manner>In "With Marion,"</manner>.
<S>descriptions of stains and discoloration</S> <V>began to appear</V> <time>as early as 1595</time>, <place>in accounts of a sarcophagus in the graceful chapel Michelangelo created as the final resting place of the Medicis</place>.
<S>plasters</S> <V>used to incessantly copy</V> <O>the masterpieces</O> <S>he</S> <V>sculpted</V> <place>atop the tombs</place> <effect>left discoloring residues</effect>.

<S>Nearly a decade of restorations</S> <V>removed</V> <O>most of the blemishes</O>, <concession>but the grime on the tomb and other stubborn stains</concession> <purpose>required special, and clandestine, attention</purpose>.
<time>In the months leading up to Italy's Covid-19 epidemic</time> and then <time>in some of the darkest days of its second wave as the virus raged outside</time>, <S>restorers and scientists</S> <V>quietly unleashed</V> <O>microbes with good taste and an enormous appetite</O> <place>on the marbles</place>, <manner>intentionally turning the chapel into a bacterial smorgasbord</manner>. "<S>It</S> <V>was</V> <effect>top secret</effect>," <S>Daniela Manna</S>, <place>one of the art restorers</place>, <V>said</V>.
<S>she</S> <V>reclined</V> <place>— like Michelangelo's allegorical sculptures of Dusk and Dawn above her —</place> <V>reached</V> <place>into the shadowy nook between the chapel wall and the sarcophagus</place> <V>to point</V> <place>at a dirty black square</place>, <O>a remnant</O> <effect>showing just how filthy the marble had become</effect>.
<S>She</S> <V>attributed</V> <O>the mess</O> <cause>to one Medici in particular, Alessandro Medici, a ruler of Florence, whose assassinated corpse had apparently been buried in the tomb without being properly eviscerated</cause>.
<S>he</S><V>seeped</V><place>into Michelangelo's marble</place>, <S>the chapel's experts</S><V>said</V>, <V>creating</V><effect>deep stains, button-shaped deformations</effect>, <S>and</S>, <time>more recently</time>, <V>providing</V><effect>a feast for the chapel's preferred cleaning product</effect>, <S>a bacterium</S><V>called</V><O>Serratia ficaria SH7</O>. <S>"SH7</S><V>ate</V><O>Alessandro,"</O> <S>Monica Bietti, former director of the Medici Chapels Museum,</S><V>said</V> <manner>as she stood in front of the now gleaming tomb</manner>, <place>surrounded by Michelangelos, dead Medicis, tourists and an all-woman team of scientists, restorers and historians</place>.
