Analysis of Differences in Constituent Order Preferences in English and Chinese News Driven by Large Models  
Ma Yiran 2022212784  
Abstract: This paper, based on a parallel corpus of English and Chinese news annotated by large models, attempts to explore the differences in constituent order between English and Chinese news genres from the perspective of functional blocks, analyzing their typical positional preferences and distribution patterns. The study finds that: (1) English news tends to favor a "core information first" linear narrative, with functional blocks often placed later, while Chinese news prefers a "background first" holistic presentation model, with functional blocks frequently placed earlier; (2) in SVO structures, both English and Chinese news exhibit differences in the distribution of functional blocks, but the tendency for fronting in Chinese is more pronounced, while the tendency for back placement in English is relatively mild; (3) when multiple functional blocks co-occur, both English and Chinese news demonstrate high flexibility in order selection, with adjustments in word order driven by information focus and pragmatic functions. This reveals that word order has both systematic preferences and dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for comparative studies of information structure in English and Chinese, and highlighting the significant role of constituent order differences in English-Chinese comparisons.

1. Introduction  
Constituent order refers to the sequence of words or phrases as functional units within grammatical structures (Jacobson, 1996; An Yuxia, 2006). When conveying information such as time, place, and manner, there are certain differences in constituent order between English and Chinese sentences, which pose challenges in language learning, communication, and usage. The difficulties mainly manifest in: (1) second language learners struggle to accurately grasp constituent positions (Li Xijiang & Liu Yongbing, 2020; Huang Yiqing, 2010), as seen in examples (1)a and (1)b, where there are significant differences in word order when conveying the same news information, showing clear preferences; (2) translators need to adjust word order to maintain the effectiveness of information transmission (Zhang Lu & Wang Fuyin, 2019), as in examples (1)b and (1)d, where translators should fully meet the word order expectations of target language users. Regarding constituent order preferences, relevant literature has only made certain qualitative judgments (Yuan Yulin, 2006; Wu Weizhang, 1995), failing to summarize the actual usage patterns of constituents.

Regarding the issue of constituent order, academia has engaged in long-term and in-depth discussions, mainly including: (1) manifestations of constituent order in grammatical units such as modifiers, adverbials, and clauses (Hu Yushu & Lu Bingfu, 1988); (2) grammatical and cognitive factors influencing constituent order (Wasow, 2003); (3) interlingual similarities and differences in constituent order and whether there are certain fixed patterns (Hawkins, 1994; Rong Jing, 2000).  
Previous research has shown the following characteristics: (1) in terms of analytical perspective, there is a tendency to start from specific grammatical units, emphasizing syntactic analysis while insufficiently considering the conveyance of semantic information (Li Jinman, 2010; Zeng Jinghan, 2015; Müller, 2021); (2) in terms of research methods, differences in word order are often inferred inductively through intuitive cognition, but limited by the scale of the corpus and subjectivity, it is difficult to extract universally supported empirical rules (Guo Zhong, 2012; Shuang Wentian, 2016; Zhang & Wang, 2022); (3) in terms of research focus, some studies emphasize the influencing factors of word order differences, while paying less attention to the distribution patterns of word order itself (Futrell, Levy & Gibson, 2020). With the development of large language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), automatic annotation provides a means to analyze large-scale word order patterns.

New possibilities have emerged. In light of this, this paper studies the distribution patterns of constituent order in English and Chinese news discourse based on an automatic annotation method using large language models, aiming to reveal the differences in constituent order preferences between English and Chinese from a data-driven perspective.

2. Research Background

2.1 Typological Manifestations of English and Chinese Word Order Differences

There is a general correlation between syntactic positions and word order types in human languages (Dryer, 1986). The constituent order in word order can be understood as the relationships and arrangements between "functional blocks." Different languages make either similar or different choices in the arrangement of functional blocks when expressing the same semantic functions, based on their respective syntactic and semantic rules (Hu Yushu & Lu Bingfu, 1988). For instance, although both English and Chinese share an SVO structure, there are differences in the order of modifiers: English often places modifiers after the head noun, while Chinese tends to place them before (Wang Kangmao & Xiao Yan, 1981). English and Chinese also have preferences in the intra-sentential positioning of information such as time, place, and manner, and these differences in constituent order are commonly found in various grammatical units such as attributive clauses, adverbial clauses, and subordinate clauses (An Yuxia, 2006).

Overall, discussions in academia regarding the classification of English and Chinese word order differences are relatively rough and provide limited help in comprehensively understanding these differences. While it is generally accepted that there are typological differences in word order between English and Chinese, intuitive typological inferences still dominate flexible choices in adverbial positions, making it difficult to summarize and extract typical distribution patterns of word order (Ding Zhibin, 2014).

Regarding the relationship between word order and syntax, Li Jinman (2010) found that although Chinese follows an SVO order, it exhibits an OV tendency in relative clauses and comparative structures, forming an atypical mixed word order characteristic in global languages. Jin Lixin (2019) also confirmed through word order indices that the VO characteristic of Chinese is reflected in verb-object structures, while showing OV characteristics in attributive and prepositional positions. Furthermore, the information progression in Chinese relies on a "topic chain," allowing adverbials to appear at the beginning of sentences, whereas English adheres more strictly to the subject-verb-object logical order (Rong Jing, 2000). These conclusions are largely based on introspective speculation and lack empirical verification through corpora.

2.2 Semantic and Information Structure Motivations

Human languages exhibit a "unidirectional change" pattern in the evolution of word order, indicating a general tendency to enhance the efficiency of syntactic structure parsing (Hawkins, 1994). English and Chinese display two characteristics in their evolution: English's "straightforward" structure places the focus at the front, while Chinese often reveals the information focus at the end of the sentence with a "finishing touch" structure (Jia Delin, 1990). English word order is constrained by factors such as syntactic structure, displacement operations, and the principle of "linear modification," with information typically arranged in the order of "known-unknown" or "weak-strong" (Chamonikolasová, 2009; Lee, 2019). Additionally, cognitive processing principles such as "dependency locality" and "externalization" exist to reduce syntactic complexity and cognitive processing load (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002; Futrell, Levy & Gibson, 2020). For example, Hannay (1991) proposed information management strategies, including "new mode," "topic mode," and "response mode," emphasizing their association with constituent frequency and cognitive fixation. Due to the lack of morphological variation, Chinese word order assumes more grammatical functions and is influenced by multiple factors such as syntactic structure, information structure, and cognitive iconicity, meeting the semantic needs of integrity and contextualization (An Yuxia, 2006). It features a tendency for information focus to appear at the end of sentences, a preference for "temporal order" arrangements, a high degree of ellipsis of known information, and an "old-new" information pattern in the "topic-comment" structure (Zhang Lianqiang, 1997; Rong Jing, 2000). There is controversy in academia regarding the flexibility of Chinese word order. Some studies on syntactic constraints and valency argue that the "word order-function" correspondence in Chinese is relatively fixed, with the arrangement of information positions controlled by information flow, the scope of modifiers, or semantic roles (Ross, 1984; Xing, 2015). However, other scholars emphasize the dynamism of Chinese word order, particularly in subordinate structures, which often exhibit a "head-final" pattern driven by pragmatic needs and semantic compatibility (Yurayong & Sandman, 2023). Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic and information structure motivations behind the differences in constituent order in news discourse based on large-scale comparable corpora of English and Chinese, in order to systematically reveal the regularities of word order differences between the two languages.

2.3 The Trend of Patterning in Word Order Distribution

In previous studies on English word order, Stolterfoht (2013) found that the positions of adverbials are not random but are often regulated by information structure principles, leading to positional preferences. Biber et al. (1999) also discovered that different types of adverbials exhibit certain tendencies in their distribution within sentences, and stylistic differences can significantly influence...

Order Distribution Bias. Zhang and Wang (2022) explored the positional distribution of temporal adverbial clauses in Chinese based on a dependency treebank, along with their syntactic and semantic characteristics. Overall, previous research has revealed a patterned tendency in the component order of English and Chinese in corpora. Traditional corpus studies often rely on manual annotation (Quirk, 1985; Ai, Zhu, Gao, & Yin, 2016), and due to limited data, it is difficult to extract broader patterns of order distribution. Travis (1984) explained the arrangement constraints between verbs and adverbials through the "domain adjacency condition" in parametric syntactic theory, but lacked empirical validation; the "dependency locality" model proposed by Futrell, Levy, and Gibson (2020) can predict word order to some extent through dependency length, but it has limitations in explicitly extracting patterns. With the application of large language models, the zero-shot chain of thought (0-Shot CoT) method proposed by Kojima et al. (2022) has inspired the possibility of automatic annotation of large-scale corpora, providing technical means for exploratory data analysis of component order differences. To more comprehensively reveal the distribution patterns of component order in English and Chinese, this paper selects a comparable corpus of English and Chinese news genres and uses large models for automatic annotation and analysis.

3. Research Design  
3.1 Research Questions  
Focusing on the news genre, this paper attempts to explore the interlingual differences in component order between English and Chinese from the perspective of functional blocks in the following three aspects: (1) the order preferences of different types of functional blocks; (2) the trends in component order within SVO-functional block combinations; (3) the order tendencies when multiple functional blocks appear simultaneously.  
3.2 Corpus Sources and Annotation  
This paper uses the CROWN2021 (Sun, Xu et al., 2022) news sub-corpus and the ToRCH2019 (Li Jialei, Sun Mingchen, & Xu Jiajin, 2022) news sub-corpus, both of which contain a wide range of news genres and are highly representative; both adopt the BROWN family corpus paradigm, ensuring comparability. CROWN2021 and ToRCH2019 are balanced American English and modern Chinese corpora, respectively, compiled by Beijing Foreign Studies University in 2021 and 2019, each containing approximately 1 million words. The English sub-corpus used in this paper contains a total of 90,131 words, while the Chinese sub-corpus contains 88,539 words, with relevant statistical data shown in Table 1. Based on semantic functions, the component functional blocks are categorized into eight types: <time>, <place>, <manner>, <cause>, <effect>, <condition>, <purpose>, and <concession>, labeled as <time>, <place>, <manner>, <cause>, <effect>, <condition>, <purpose>, and <concession>, respectively. The subject, verb, and object are labeled as <S>, <V>, and <O> to facilitate the control of the same SVO structure in both English and Chinese, studying the distribution of functional blocks decoupled from SVO. For clauses, they are treated as multiple SVO structures. Words or phrases that cannot be classified into the above functional blocks are designated as unannotated, allowing for gaps. Balancing efficiency and reliability, the currently leading GPT 4o model API interface is used, combined with a few-shot prompting strategy to guide the model in labeling according to the tagging system. Actual annotation examples and abstract versions are shown in example (2), with relevant statistical results in Tables 2–4.

3 Regarding the effectiveness and limitations of using large language models for automatic annotation, there has been relevant discussion in academia. Although they can achieve or even surpass the capabilities of crowd-sourced annotators (Alizadeh et al., 2024) and have high scalability, they still face issues such as bias and hallucination, and their capabilities are limited in scenarios requiring high levels of expertise. Methods such as enhancing data diversity, introducing model self-correction mechanisms, and quantifying compression may alleviate these issues (Tan et al., 2024). In light of this, this paper introduces a few-shot prompting strategy, adding three original sentences and their manually annotated counterparts to the fine-tuning examples input into the model, and providing specific examples for each type of functional block in the prompts. Although it cannot achieve the quality of human expert annotation on a sentence-by-sentence basis, this method ensures the usability of annotations at the macro statistical level. The annotation process is conducted in parallel twice to simulate a dual annotator strategy, calculating the annotation consistency after independently completing the annotation of the same batch of data. The annotation consistency of this method is above 0.95.

3.3 Statistical Analysis
This paper explores the distribution characteristics of functional blocks in English and Chinese news genres and their syntactic order based on statistical methods, aiming to reveal the preference differences in constituent order between the two languages. Construction grammar (Goldberg, 1995) points out that constructions and their internal components have cognitive fixation, stemming from categorization and patterning formed in high-frequency language input, while the close relationship between constituent order and information structure can also be approximated as a form of preference fixation and generalization. In this process, constituent order gradually adapts to its semantic function; at the statistical level, under the condition of expressing the same semantic information, the preference for constituent order shows significant differences from the uniform distribution hypothesis.

From this perspective, we can infer that if the relative position of functional blocks in a sentence shows significant differences (< 0.05) compared to the uniform distribution hypothesis, it indicates that their positional preference has a certain degree of systematicity and stability. To this end, this paper combines frequency analysis, chi-square tests, independent sample t-tests, and Markov chain transition matrix analysis to explore: (1) the intra-sentential positional preferences of different types of functional blocks; (2) the combinatory patterns of functional blocks with the SVO framework; (3) the arrangement patterns and distribution tendencies of multiple functional blocks.

4. Research Findings  
4.1 Distribution Characteristics of Different Types of Functional Blocks within Sentences  
In Chinese news, the distribution of various functional blocks within sentences shows significant preferences, overall exhibiting a tendency for front positioning (the frequency distribution histogram can be found in Appendix Figure 1). In the chi-square tests conducted for various functional blocks, <time> and <location> are highly concentrated at the beginning of sentences (time: χ² = 612.81, p < 0.001; location: χ² = 332.63, p < 0.001), reflecting the linguistic habit in Chinese of first establishing the temporal and spatial context in narratives. <Condition> and <concession> are also primarily located at the beginning of sentences (condition: χ² = 10.18, p = 0.001; concession: χ² = 17.32, p < 0.001), indicating that Chinese prefers to set conditions or concessions at the outset to guide the logical development of sentences. Additionally, <reason> also shows a tendency for front positioning (χ² = 5.99, p = 0.014), reflecting the Chinese tendency to prioritize the organization of background reasons in information. However, the distribution of other functional blocks is relatively insignificant. The distribution of <manner> is quite uniform (χ² = 0.13, p = 0.72), as seen in the histogram, with no clear preference in sentence position; the distribution of <result> shows no significant difference (χ² = 0.018, p = 0.89), while the distribution of <purpose> is the most balanced (χ² = 0.28, p = 0.60). These distribution characteristics reveal the uniqueness of the Chinese news register in information organization: by prominently placing functional blocks such as <time>, <location>, <condition>, and <reason> at the front, a clear contextual framework for the narrative is established, while other functional blocks are flexibly distributed to meet different contextual needs, closely related to the Chinese emphasis on wholeness and information groundwork.

The distribution of functional blocks within sentences in English news also exhibits significant characteristics, overall showing a tendency for back positioning, which is the opposite of Chinese (the frequency distribution histogram can be found in Appendix Figure 2). <Result> is concentrated at the end of sentences, with the most significant distribution (χ² = 135.62, p < 0.001), reflecting the characteristic of English to place core information at the end of sentences to highlight key points. The distribution of <purpose> follows, also significantly biased towards the end of sentences (χ² = 100.24, p < 0.001), demonstrating a preference for placing explanatory information at the end. <Reason> is mainly located in the middle to the back of sentences (χ² = 94.76, p < 0.001), providing support for background information. The distribution of <manner> is relatively concentrated in the middle or towards the back of sentences (χ² = 42.59, p < 0.001), but its flexibility is slightly higher than that of other functional blocks. <Concession> significantly leans towards the latter part of the sentence (χ² = 40.07, p < 0.001), similar to the positions of other functional blocks that emphasize conditions or logical relationships. <Time> and <location> are also concentrated at the end of sentences, with significant distributions (time: χ² = 18.99, p < 0.001; location: χ² = 31.29, p < 0.001), further reflecting the characteristic of English syntactic structure that emphasizes the linear progression of temporal and spatial information. In contrast, the distribution of <condition> shows weaker differences, but still statistically demonstrates a certain tendency towards the back of the sentence (χ² = 4.14, p = 0.042). These distribution patterns showcase the distinct characteristics of English news in information organization, where functional blocks are positioned at the end to reinforce core focal information while maintaining the logicality and linear development of the narrative, allowing the core of events to gain greater cognitive priority at the beginning of sentences.

In the interlingual comparison, all functional blocks show significant differences under the t-test with p < 0.05. The distribution difference of <time> is the most significant (p < 1−275), with Chinese tending to place time at the beginning of sentences, while English prefers the end, reflecting a fundamental difference in the information organization logic of the two languages. The distribution difference of <location> follows closely (p < 1−227), where location information in Chinese is typically positioned at the beginning to set the spatial context for the narrative, while English tends to place it at the end, consistent with the linear information progression model. The difference in <manner> (p < 1−104) shows that Chinese flexibly handles modifiers at the beginning or middle of sentences, while English exhibits a stronger preference for back positioning. The functional blocks of cause and effect also show significant distribution differences (reason: p < 1−20; result: p < 1−26), reflecting that Chinese tends to place explanatory information at the front, while English often highlights results at the end. The differences in <condition> and <concession> are also significant (condition: p < 1−15; concession: p < 1−40), reflecting the different arrangements of logical relationship information in the two languages, with Chinese emphasizing logical groundwork and English valuing the back positioning of background information. The distribution difference of <purpose> is also quite significant (p < 1−17), further reflecting the systematic differences in the information progression methods of functional blocks in English and Chinese news. Overall, the two languages exhibit different preferences and patterns in the distribution of functional blocks within sentences, revealing deep-seated differences in word order arrangement, information structure, and logical thinking.

4.2 Comparison of the Combination Patterns of Functional Blocks and the SVO Framework  
To explore the relationship between functional blocks and SVO, we first counted the frequency of each type of functional block appearing before and after S, V, and O, approximating the probabilities based on frequency. The frequency analysis of Chinese shows that the distribution of functional blocks is more concentrated, clearly exhibiting a strong preference for fronting regarding S, V, and O (see Table 5). Among the significantly different functional blocks, <time>, <place>, and <cause> are particularly prominent in their distribution before verbs and objects. The probability of <time> appearing before the verb is as high as 0.98, while it is only 0.03 after the verb; before the object, the probability is 0.97, while after the object it is 0.03. These differences are related to the preference in Chinese news narratives to emphasize the priority of time, space, and contextual logic, with a tendency to provide clear background information through functional blocks at the beginning of the sentence or before the verb. For the less significantly different functional blocks, such as <manner> and <condition>, the distribution before and after the subject is more flexible. For example, the probability of <manner> appearing before the subject is 0.57, while after the subject it is 0.43; although there is a slight preference for fronting, the distribution is relatively even. The probability of <condition> appearing before the subject is 0.69, while after the subject it is 0.31, still showing a certain preference for fronting, but the difference is milder. This distribution may be related to the modifying role that functional blocks play in sentences; for instance, <manner> can modify both the subject and the verb, leading to a more balanced distribution before and after the subject. Overall, the combination patterns of Chinese functional blocks with S, V, and O show a strong preference for fronting, especially for <time>, <place>, and <cause>, which are significantly concentrated at the beginning of the sentence or before the verb; while <manner> and <condition> are more flexible in their distribution before and after the subject, reflecting the combination of background priority and narrative flexibility in Chinese information organization.

| Functional Block | Before S | After S | Before V | After V | Before O | After O |  
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |  
| <manner> | 0.57 | 0.43 | 0.88 | 0.12 | 0.93 | 0.07 |  
| <place> | 0.72 | 0.28 | 0.94 | 0.06 | 0.94 | 0.06 |  
| <effect> | 0.58 | 0.42 | 0.67 | 0.33 | 0.72 | 0.28 |  
| <time> | 0.81 | 0.19 | 0.98 | 0.03 | 0.97 | 0.03 |  
| <purpose> | 0.61 | 0.39 | 0.81 | 0.19 | 0.84 | 0.17 |  
| <cause> | 0.78 | 0.22 | 0.96 | 0.04 | 0.92 | 0.08 |  
| <condition> | 0.69 | 0.31 | 0.93 | 0.08 | 0.89 | 0.11 |  
| <concession> | 0.77 | 0.23 | 0.96 | 0.04 | 0.95 | 0.05 |  

In contrast, the distribution of functional blocks in English shows greater flexibility, with smaller differences in probabilities between positions (see Table 6). The distribution of <result>, <cause>, and <purpose> is slightly more frequent after the verb and object. For example, the probability of <result> appearing before the verb is 0.33, while after the verb it is 0.67. The distribution trends for <cause> and <purpose> are similar, with probabilities of 0.73 and 0.71 after the object, higher than the probabilities of 0.27 and 0.29 before the object. These distribution characteristics of functional blocks may be related to the requirements of narrative logic in English news, which emphasizes placing information about results, causes, or purposes at the end of sentences to highlight the grammatical core and achieve logical progression. The distributions of <time>, <place>, and <manner> are more balanced. For instance, the probability of <time> appearing before the verb is 0.44, while after the verb it is 0.56, showing a small difference and presenting a relatively flexible arrangement. This balanced distribution may reflect that these functional blocks can be used to modify information at the beginning of the sentence as well as to provide supplementary explanations for actions or objects at the end of the sentence, demonstrating the flexibility and adaptability of functional block arrangements in English news. Overall, the distribution of functional blocks in English is more uniform compared to Chinese, with <result>, <cause>, and <purpose> showing a certain tendency for post-positioning, while <time>, <place>, and <manner> exhibit more flexible distributions with smaller differences between positions. This distribution pattern reflects the diversified arrangement of functional block positions in English news, providing greater freedom for narration while also embodying the language's characteristics of logical progression and focus.

Next, we extracted the top 20 frequency functional blocks – SVO distribution patterns, with complete data available in Appendix Tables 1 and 2. According to the statistical data, in Chinese, the top three distribution patterns are <time><S><V><O> (17 times), <place><S><V><O> (13 times), and <manner><V><O> (13 times), which further confirms the preference for fronting functional blocks in Chinese. This indicates that Chinese news often provides clear background information at the beginning of the sentence or before the subject through functional blocks, laying a logical foundation or supplementary details for the narrative content. In the specific corpus, we selected the following three typical patterns for analysis. The <place><S><V><O> pattern is a typical distribution pattern that showcases the characteristic of <place> being positioned at the beginning of the sentence. For example:  
<place>From the snowy plains of high mountains to the vast seas</place>, <place>from border towns to urban and rural areas</place>, <place>canteens, shower rooms, reading rooms</place>… <S>the working and living environment of grassroots police officers</S><V>has always been</V><O>a matter of great importance and concern for the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Party Committee of the Ministry of Public Security</O>. (ToRCH2019-A01-38)  
In this sentence, multiple consecutive <place> elements appear before the subject, setting a rich and specific spatial background. This arrangement reinforces the common "from background to subject" logical structure in Chinese narratives. The <time><place><S><V><O> pattern demonstrates the tendency for the joint fronting of time and place functional blocks. For example:  
<time>Since 2018</time>, <place>in Dehua County, Fujian Province</place>, <S>the Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission</S><V>have successively investigated</V><O>cases of embezzlement of huge public funds by two financial personnel of a state-owned enterprise and the escape of a public official involved in a criminal offense for 18 years</O>. (ToRCH2019-A10-33)  
The time and place functional blocks appear consecutively at the beginning of the sentence, clarifying the temporal and spatial scope of the narrative. This combination pattern further illustrates the regularity of functional block arrangement in Chinese news: reinforcing the informational background through dual functional blocks, providing sufficient groundwork and layers for the main clause's narrative. Another typical pattern is <place><S><manner><V><O>, such as:  
<place>At the event site</place>, <S>the guests</S><manner>expressed</manner><V>their</V><O>enthusiastic response to the declaration of building a beautiful China and co-creating a beautiful Earth</O>. (ToRCH2019-A09-13)  
In this sentence, the <place> is positioned at the beginning to introduce the scene, while the <manner> is inserted between the subject and verb to modify the manner of the action. This flexible combination reflects the flexibility of functional block distribution in Chinese news, consistent with the conclusion that <manner> can appear both before and after the subject. Through these typical patterns, we can see...

The combination of Chinese functional blocks and SVO not only reflects the overall preference for fronting of functional blocks but also showcases the characteristics of coordinated fronting and a certain degree of flexibility, partially revealing the patterns in Chinese news regarding the presentation of information context and narrative logic.

In English news, the combination pattern of functional blocks and SVO fully demonstrates the characteristic of functional blocks providing supplementary information after the main clause. According to statistics, the patterns <S><V><effect>, <S><V><O><time>, and <S><V><O><effect> are the top three distribution patterns, appearing 127 times, 81 times, and 70 times, respectively. This indicates that English news tends to prioritize presenting the core information of subject-verb-object, while functional blocks are mostly postposed, used to gradually refine the background or supplement logical layers. This pattern effectively ensures the efficiency of information retrieval while extending supplementary details at the end of the sentence, adding layers and logic to the narrative. The following analysis will focus on three typical patterns through example sentences.

The <S><V><O><time> pattern is a distribution pattern that highly reflects the postposing characteristic, such as:
<S>Neal</S><V>will assume</V><O>the helm of the nation's immigration court system</O><time>at a time when the Biden administration is wrestling with increasing arrivals at the US-Mexico border and seeking to reform a system that's been plagued with issues</time>. (CROWN2021-A03AA)
In this sentence, the SVO structure first directly conveys the key information. Subsequently, the <time> provides specific background. This arrangement allows readers to quickly grasp the core information, while the temporal background information is gradually revealed at the end of the sentence, avoiding overly lengthy introductory modifiers that could interfere with the main structure.

The <S><V><O><place> pattern further illustrates the distribution rules of functional blocks in English news, such as:
<S>Cuyjet (pronounced SOO-zhay)</S><V>also has</V><O>a video piece, "For All Your Life Studies,"</O><place>in an exhibition called "In Practice: You may go, but this will bring you back," at SculptureCenter in Long Island City</place>. (CROWN2021-A43AD)
In this sentence, the SVO structure also quickly presents the main event, while the <place> postposes to provide specific spatial information about the event. This sentence structure makes the event description direct and compact, while the spatial background gradually unfolds at the end, clarifying the context without interfering with the core information.

The <S><V><O><time><cause> pattern reflects the supplementary role of functional blocks in logical relationships, such as:
<S>The White House</S><V>announced</V><O>a series of sanctions</O><time>on Friday night</time><cause>for its forced landing of a Ryanair commercial flight and the subsequent removal and arrest of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich</cause>. (CROWN2021-A04AE)
In this sentence, the <time> and <cause> are added sequentially at the end. This gradual postposing, although not strictly adhering to logical order, enriches the background and logic layer by layer while maintaining the conciseness of the main clause, making the organization of information easier to accept. These example sentences clearly reflect that English news achieves the expression strategy of "quickly capturing subject-verb-object information while gradually refining the background" through the postposing of functional blocks. The fronting of subject-verb-object and the postposing of functional blocks complement each other, allowing the narrative to remain compact and efficient in logical progression while providing space for the presentation of complex background information. This characteristic not only enhances the readability of the sentences but also strengthens the layered organization of information.

4.3 The Order and Distribution Patterns of Multiple Functional Blocks
We first analyzed the multiple combination patterns of functional blocks and counted the top 50 frequencies of co-occurring functional blocks, with specific results shown in Appendix Tables 3 and 4. Looking at the top 10 positions (see Tables 7 and 8), both Chinese and English have <time><place> as the most frequent combination, indicating a certain similarity in the arrangement and combination of functional blocks in both languages, overall presenting a highly flexible characteristic, with both fixed combinations of functional blocks like time and place, as well as more diverse combinations of other functional blocks. In Chinese, <place><manner> and <place><time> occupy the second and third positions in frequency, showing a tendency for the diversified co-occurrence of place functional blocks. In English, the high-frequency combinations are more concentrated on causal and purpose functional blocks, such as...

<time><cause> and <effect><time>. Nevertheless, the two languages did not show significant differences, which may be related to the scale and scope of the corpus. It is noteworthy that combinations containing three functional blocks also appeared in the statistics, but generally lacked interlingual statistical significance, further illustrating that the flexibility of combination patterns is not concentrated in specific complex patterns.

| 8 | <time><effect> | 63 |  
| 9 | <place><purpose> | 58 |  
| 10 | <place><effect> | 55 |  

Inspired by Markov chains, we further analyzed the transition relationships between functional blocks and constructed a transition matrix, with specific results found in Appendix Tables 5–8. By comparing the top 10 transition probabilities (see Tables 9 and 10), we found that the highest transition probability in Chinese is from <place> to <manner>, reaching 0.55, while <purpose> to <manner> and <condition> to <manner> also ranked in the top 3. In contrast, English showed higher transition probabilities from <condition> to <effect> (0.33) and from <cause> to <effect> (0.28).  
Overall, there is no significant tendency or uniqueness in the arrangement and distribution of multiple functional blocks in both languages, reflecting the high flexibility and diversity of functional block combinations. Although some transitions between functional blocks showed certain preferences within their respective languages, this preference is not sufficient to form universally meaningful conclusions. Combining the analysis of the transition matrix and functional block combination patterns, we speculate that this flexibility may reflect that the information organization in the syntactic structures of the two languages does not significantly restrict the collocation of functional blocks, but rather allows them to combine freely according to contextual needs.

5. Discussion  
5.1 The Functional Alignment of Linear Narrative and Overall Presentation  
Statistical results indicate that the distribution of component order in English and Chinese news discourse exhibits significant contrasting features, with the core difference reflected in the presentation order of core events and background information when conveying the same informational function. English typically adopts a "core information first" linear narrative model, establishing the skeletal structure of events at the outset and subsequently elaborating on secondary background information such as time and place. A notable characteristic of this model is the prominence of the main information line and the clarity of logical progression, making the core content easier to identify and remember. This distribution pattern also reflects Dryer’s (1986) "topic prominence hypothesis," which suggests that in terms of word order arrangement, English tends to place the grammatical core in a prominent position to enhance the explicit expression of information. This model clarifies the focus and logical main line of the narrative, thereby enhancing the directness and coherence of the information. In actual English corpora, this tendency to place background information later constitutes a significant distribution pattern. In contrast, the narrative structure of Chinese leans towards an "background first" overall presentation model. A common expression method is to provide contextual information such as time, place, or manner to support the narrative framework, while the core event often appears at the end of the sentence as a "finishing touch."  
The characteristic of this narrative strategy lies in the progressive and contextual nature of the information, highlighting the coherence and completeness of the narrative. In Chinese corpora, the significant pre-positioning of time and place functional blocks also validates Rong Jing's (2000) proposed "background-focus" structure in Chinese, which indicates that Chinese tends to provide support for core events through contextual elaboration and guides readers into the narrative logic through progressive information unfolding. This model showcases the gradual and holistic nature of information presentation in Chinese news, complementing the narrative tradition. The pre-positioning distribution of functional blocks such as time and place in Chinese corpora evidently becomes a major feature of this model.  
In summary, English news discourse forms a linear narrative model that combines focus and progression through the priority transmission of core information and the later distribution of background information; whereas Chinese news combines overall expression characteristics of elaboration and progression through the pre-positioning of background components such as time and place and the gradual revelation of core events. This distribution pattern of components not only partially supports the descriptions of English and Chinese word order characteristics by Wang Kangmao and Xiao Yan (1981) from the perspective of functional distribution, indicating that English places more emphasis on information centrality while Chinese tends to favor semantic holism. The above differences reflect systematic characteristics in the component order preferences of English and Chinese news discourse, providing a solid foundation for further exploration of their deeper motivations. It is important to note that the features observed in this paper are largely constrained by the nature of news discourse itself, and future research could explore the cross-discourse consistency and variability of English and Chinese component order patterns by expanding the range of corpora and discourse types.  
5.2 The Multidimensional Projection of Syntactic Structure and Cognitive Patterns  
The differences in component order distribution between English and Chinese news discourse not only reflect the surface characteristics of the syntactic structures of the two languages but also reveal their differences in cognitive patterns, semantic expression, and cultural traditions at deeper levels. This difference is manifested in the organization of core events and background information in news narratives, as well as the selection of arrangement rules between functional blocks, possessing multidimensional theoretical significance and practical value.  
Firstly, from the perspective of syntactic structure (Ji, 2015), English tends to favor formality, with syntactic relationships expressed through strict formal markers and relatively fixed rules. This characteristic of formality ensures the linear progression of information and logical coherence. In actual corpora, background information such as <time> and <place> is often placed later, making the core events in the SVO framework more prominent in the logical main line. In contrast, Chinese primarily relies on semantic coherence, with syntactic relationships more often reflected through semantic associations and contextual inferences. In the corpora, functional blocks such as <time> and <place> frequently appear at the beginning of sentences, constructing a complete narrative background before gradually unfolding the core events, highlighting Chinese reliance on overall semantics and contextual connections.  
Secondly, the differences in semantic and cognitive patterns further deepen the different preferences in English and Chinese word order (Scollon, 2000). The cognitive pattern in English emphasizes a "separation of subject and object," with a clear subject and predicate at its core, and the linear distribution of functional blocks distinctly differentiates the participants and background information of events. This cognitive logic reflects the individual-centered and logical reasoning traditions in English culture. In contrast, the cognitive pattern in Chinese places greater emphasis on the holistic concept of "unity of heaven and humanity" (Jia Delin, 1990; Zeng Jinghan, 2015). The high-frequency distribution of background components such as time and place at the beginning of sentences not only reflects grammatical connections but also constructs a comprehensive narrative context before gradually revealing the core events, underscoring the dependence of Chinese on overall semantics and contextual relationships.

The semantic orientation of the structure also reveals the emphasis of Chinese on context and overall coherence in event narration. This pattern constructs a more complete semantic network and contextual information for the presentation of core events through the elaboration of background information.

Moreover, cultural factors profoundly influence the component order preferences in English and Chinese news discourse. English culture emphasizes the centrality of individual actions and the focus on outcomes, thus prioritizing the logical actions of core events in narration and placing background information later to enhance the significance of the events. In contrast, Chinese culture pays more attention to the interaction between the environment and behavior, tending to present background information first to showcase the interaction between events and contexts. For example, in news corpora, Chinese often conveys a holistic understanding of culture through detailed descriptions of scenes, such as creating a grand narrative of time and space before introducing specific actions or outcomes in reports of major events (Scollon, 2000).

In summary, the differences in component order between English and Chinese news discourse reflect the deep mechanisms of the two languages in terms of syntactic structure, cognitive patterns, semantic expression, and cultural traditions. English primarily emphasizes form coherence, highlighting core events through linear distribution and logical progression; Chinese primarily emphasizes meaning coherence, highlighting the continuity of background through holistic elaboration and contextualized expression. This difference is not only a natural reflection of the syntactic and semantic functions of the two languages but also a multidimensional projection of cognition and cultural traditions in language. Future research can further combine more discourse types and functional blocks to explore the universality and specificity of these mechanisms in different languages, providing deeper theoretical support for comparative language studies and cross-cultural communication.

5.3 Flexible Adaptation Mechanism in Fixed Preferences

The distribution of component order in English and Chinese news discourse shows significant patterned characteristics, but these patterns are by no means completely fixed; rather, they possess a certain degree of flexibility. This flexibility is mainly influenced by information structure, pragmatic needs, and specific contexts, reflecting the dual characteristics of preference and adaptability in component order in both English and Chinese. This observation provides new empirical support for the academic debate on word order.

From an overall perspective, there are systematic preferences in the distribution of component order in English and Chinese news discourse. For example, background information is often placed later in English news, while in Chinese, it tends to be placed earlier. However, this preference does not imply absolute rigidity in word order. For instance, in English corpora, when certain background elements (such as time) carry important discourse functions, their position may shift from later to earlier to enhance their prominence. For example:

<time>This month</time>, <S>the court</S> <V>became embroiled</V> <O>in a dramatic and highly divisive debate</O> <cause>over abortion in Texas</cause> (CROWN2021-A12AB)

In this sentence, the time element "This month" is placed at the beginning because it plays an important role in linking the preceding and following information, while also setting the temporal context for the subsequent narration. Such adjustments demonstrate the flexible adaptability of English word order to pragmatic needs. Similarly, Chinese news also exhibits flexible arrangements of word order. For example:

<S>30多岁的女性</S><V>叫</V><O>杨琴</O>，<place>来自大为公司</place>，<time>2016年初</time><V>中标</V><O>新馆家具采购项目</O>。(ToRCH2019-A05-21)

In this sentence, the <place> and <time> elements are positioned after the core SVO structure. Although this distribution does not conform to the typical preference of placing time elements at the beginning of Chinese sentences, it reinforces the causal relationship between the time background and the event by adhering to the logical needs of the context. This indicates that even within the "background first" model of Chinese, there can be flexible adjustments under certain discourse demands.

The academic debate regarding whether word order has fixed rules often focuses on the relationship between grammar and information structure. On one hand, traditional research suggests that component order is influenced by typological differences, with grammar largely constraining information structure; on the other hand, recent studies have increasingly emphasized the pragmatic driving force of word order, pointing out that the choice of word order depends more on information focus, topic progression, and contextual adaptation. This paper, through a comparative analysis of English and Chinese news corpora, finds that component order exhibits both stable distribution patterns and flexibility driven by pragmatic needs. This flexibility reflects the language's response to cognitive demands.

2024 Autumn Term Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications School of Humanities English Major "Corpus Linguistics" Course Paper

The adaptability of knowledge and information organization needs. For example, the English principle of "dependency locality" encourages linear progression, but in certain contexts, to highlight the topic or simplify cognitive load, some background information may be placed at the front. Conversely, while the Chinese "topic chain" structure emphasizes overall presentation, it can also place background information at the end when certain information focuses need to be highlighted. These phenomena collectively illustrate the coexistence of preference and flexibility in word order.

In summary, the distribution of component order in English and Chinese news discourse exhibits both systematic preferences and the ability for flexible adjustment. This dual characteristic provides a balanced explanation for the debate over whether word order is "fixed." The choice of word order largely depends on pragmatic needs, information focus, and contextual logic, which not only expands our understanding of the characteristics of English and Chinese word order but also offers important reference directions for further research on cross-genre patterns of word order.

6. Conclusion

Based on a large-scale English-Chinese news corpus and automatic annotation using large language models, this paper attempts to explore the differences in component order preferences and their arrangement patterns from the perspective of functional blocks. The study finds that: (1) Components such as time and place exhibit significant word order preferences in English and Chinese news discourse. English tends to place these functional blocks at the end of sentences, reinforcing the central position of core event information; whereas Chinese shows a stronger tendency to place them at the front, highlighting the importance of background information at the beginning of the narrative. (2) The combination patterns of SVO structure and functional blocks reflect the differences in word order between English and Chinese news, but the degree of this difference varies. The fronting tendency in Chinese is significant, while the postposing characteristic in English is relatively mild, reflecting the different focuses of information organization in the two languages. (3) When multiple functional blocks co-occur, both English and Chinese news discourse demonstrate high flexibility in component order, with adjustments driven by information focus, pragmatic needs, and discourse functions. The above findings reveal to some extent the differences in word order preferences in English and Chinese news discourse and the different strategies in information organization, not only validating existing theoretical typological hypotheses about word order distribution but also providing new empirical support for the pragmatic adaptation mechanisms of word order.
