Contrastive Analysis of Constituent Order Preferences Within Adverbial Roles in English and Chinese News: A Large-Language-Model-Driven Approach  
Ma Yiran, School of Humanities  
Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear narrative of “core information first”, and functional chunks are mostly post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of “background first”, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3) When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of English-Chinese information structure.

1. Introduction  
Constituent order refers to the sequence of words or phrases as functional units within grammatical structures (Jacobson 1996; An Yuxia 2006), which is a type of word order. There are certain differences in constituent order when English and Chinese sentences convey adverbial information such as time, place, and manner, which become challenges in language learning, communication, and usage. The difficulties mainly manifest in: (1) Second language learners find it hard to accurately grasp the position of constituents (Li Xijiang & Liu Yongbing 2020; Huang Yiqing 2010), as shown in examples (1)a and (1)b, where there are significant differences in word order when conveying the same news information, reflecting clear preferences. (2) Translators need to adjust word order to maintain the effectiveness of information transmission (Zhang Lu & Wang Fuyin 2019), as in examples (1)b and (1)d, where translators should fully meet the word order expectations of target language users. Regarding constituent order preferences, relevant literature has only made certain qualitative judgments (Yuan Yulin 2006; Wu Weizhang 1995), making it difficult to summarize the actual usage patterns of constituents.

The academic community has engaged in long-term and in-depth discussions regarding the issues of word order and adverbial order, mainly including: (1) the manifestation of word order in grammatical units such as modifiers, adverbials, and clauses (Hu Yushu & Lu Bingfu 1988); (2) grammatical and cognitive factors influencing word order and adverbial order (Wasow 2003); (3) similarities and differences in interlanguage word order and whether there are certain fixed patterns (Hawkins 1994; Rong Jing 2000).

Previous research presents the following characteristics: (1) In terms of analytical perspective, there is a tendency to start from specific grammatical units, emphasizing syntactic analysis while insufficiently considering the conveyance of semantic information (Li Jinman 2010; Zeng Jinghan 2015; Müller 2021); (2) In terms of research methods, differences in word order are often inferred inductively through intuitive cognition, but due to limitations in corpus size and subjectivity, it is difficult to extract universally supported empirical rules (Guo Zhong 2012; Shuang Wentian 2016; Zhang & Wang 2022); (3) In terms of research focus, some studies emphasize the influencing factors of word order differences, while paying less attention to the distribution patterns of word order itself (Futrell, Levy & Gibson 2020). Hu Yushu and Lu Bingfu (1988) pointed out that constituent order can be understood as the relationship and arrangement between "functional blocks." Different languages, when expressing the same semantic function, will make either similar or different choices in the arrangement of "functional blocks" based on their respective syntactic and semantic rules. With the development of large language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023), the automatic annotation of "functional blocks" in corpora has made it possible to efficiently analyze large-scale word order patterns. In light of this, this paper attempts to study the distribution patterns of constituent order in English and Chinese news discourse from the perspective of adverbial functional blocks, aiming to reveal the differences in constituent order preferences between English and Chinese through data-driven analysis.

2. Research Background
2.1 Typological Manifestations of English and Chinese Word Order Differences
There is a general correlation between syntactic positions and word order types in human languages (Dryer 1986). For instance, although both English and Chinese share an SVO structure, there are differences in the order of modifying elements: English often places modifiers after the head noun, while Chinese tends to place them before (Wang Kangmao & Xiao Yan 1981). When conveying information about time, place, and manner, English and Chinese each have their preferences in sentence-internal position selection, and this difference in constituent order is commonly found in various grammatical units such as attributive clauses, adverbials, and subordinate clauses (An Yuxia 2006). Overall, discussions in academia have categorized the differences in English and Chinese word order rather roughly, providing limited help for a comprehensive understanding of these differences. Although it is generally accepted that there are typological differences in word order between English and Chinese, intuitive typological inferences still underpin flexible choices regarding adverbial positions, making it difficult to extract typical word order distribution patterns (Ding Zhibin 2014).

Regarding the relationship between word order and syntax, Li Jinman (2010) found that although Chinese follows an SVO order, it exhibits an OV tendency in relative clauses and comparative structures, forming an atypical mixed word order characteristic among global languages. Jin Lixin (2019) also confirmed through word order index measurements that the VO characteristic of Chinese is reflected in verb-object structures, while showing OV characteristics in attributive and prepositional positions. Furthermore, the information progression in Chinese relies on a "topic chain," allowing adverbials to appear at the beginning of sentences, whereas English adheres more strictly to the logical order of subject-verb-object (Rong Jing 2000). The above conclusions are largely based on introspective speculation and lack empirical verification from corpora.

2.2 Semantic and Information Structure Motivations
Human languages exhibit a "unidirectional change" pattern in the evolution of word order, showing a general tendency to enhance the efficiency of syntactic structure parsing (Hawkins 1994). Consequently, there are commonalities in the discourse information progression between English and Chinese. For example, Liu & Guo (2014) and Guo Hua (2022) respectively found a series of shared theme progression patterns in English and Chinese in broadcast and academic discourse by combining Halliday's (1985) theme and rheme theory. However, English and Chinese have gradually diverged in their evolution: English structures often place the focus at the beginning, while Chinese tends to reveal the information focus at the end of the sentence with a "finishing touch" structure. 

2 English sentence types are typically categorized into seven types: SV, SVO, SVC, SVA, SVOO, SVOC, and SVOA (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985), with SVO being the most common. There are different interpretations regarding Chinese: one viewpoint holds that subject-verb-object (SVO) is the basic word order of modern Chinese (Wang Li, 1980); another viewpoint argues that as a character-based language, summarizing Chinese with an SVO framework is inappropriate and should use "topic-comment" (Zhao Yuanren, 1968; Zhang Bojiang, 2011). This paper will not discuss this further. For the sake of comparison, we will tentatively assume that English and Chinese are consistent in the SVO structure, which is the most common sentence type.

De Lin (1990). The word order in English is constrained by factors such as syntactic structure, displacement operations, and the principle of "linear modification," with information typically arranged in the order of "known–unknown" or "weak–strong" (Chamonikolasová 2009; Lee 2019). Additionally, there are cognitive processing principles such as "dependency locality" and "externalization" that reduce syntactic complexity and cognitive processing load (Huddleston & Pullum 2002; Futrell, Levy & Gibson 2020). For example, the information management strategies proposed by Hannay (1991), including "new pattern," "topic pattern," and "response pattern," emphasize their correlation with constituent frequency and cognitive fixation. Due to the lack of morphological changes, Chinese word order assumes more grammatical functions and is influenced by multiple factors such as syntactic structure, information structure, and cognitive iconicity, meeting the semantic needs of integrity and contextualization (An Yuxia 2006). It features a tendency for information focus at the end of sentences, a high degree of ellipsis of known information, and an "old–new" information pattern (Zhang Lianqiang 1997; Rong Jing 2000). There is controversy in academia regarding the flexibility of word order. Some constraint-based syntactic studies and valency studies argue that the "word order–function" correspondence is relatively fixed, with the arrangement of information positions controlled by information flow, the scope of modifiers, or semantic roles (Ross 1984; Xing 2015). However, some scholars emphasize the dynamism of word order, noting that in Chinese subordinate structures, a "head-final" pattern often appears, driven by pragmatic needs and semantic compatibility (Yurayong & Sandman 2023). In light of this, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic and informational structural motivations behind the differences in constituent order in news discourse, based on large-scale comparable corpora of English and Chinese, starting from the differences in word order preferences.

2.3 The Patterned Trend of Word Order Distribution
In previous studies on English word order, Stolterfoht (2013) found that the position of adverbials is not random but often influenced by information structure principles that create positional preferences. Biber et al. (1999) also discovered that different types of adverbials exhibit certain tendencies in their distribution within sentences, and stylistic differences can significantly affect word order distribution tendencies. Zhang and Wang (2022) explored the positional distribution and syntactic and semantic characteristics of Chinese temporal adverbial clauses based on a dependency treebank. Overall, previous research has revealed a patterned tendency in the constituent order of English and Chinese in corpora. Traditional corpus studies often rely on manual annotation (Ai, Zhu, Gao, & Yin 2016), and due to limited data, it is challenging to extract broader patterns of word order distribution. Travis (1984) explained the constraints on the arrangement of verbs and adverbials through the "domain adjacency condition" in parametric syntactic theory, but lacked empirical validation; the "dependency locality" model proposed by Futrell, Levy, and Gibson (2020) can predict word order to some extent based on dependency length, but it has limitations in explicitly extracting patterns. With the application of large language models, the zero-shot chain of thought (0-Shot CoT) method proposed by Kojima et al. (2022) has inspired the possibility of automatic annotation of large-scale corpora, providing technical means for exploratory data analysis of differences in constituent order. To more comprehensively reveal the distribution patterns of constituent order in English and Chinese, this paper selects comparable corpora of English and Chinese news discourse and uses large models for automatic annotation and analysis.

3. Research Design
3.1 Research Questions
Focusing on news discourse, this paper attempts to explore the intra-sentential preferences and inter-linguistic differences in the constituent order of English and Chinese from the perspective of adverbial functional blocks in the following three aspects: (1) the word order preferences of different types of functional blocks; (2) the trends in constituent order within SVO–functional block combinations; (3) the order tendencies when multiple functional blocks appear simultaneously. 

3.2 Corpus Sources and Annotation
This paper uses the CROWN2021 (Sun, Xu et al. 2022) news sub-corpus and the ToRCH2019 (Li Jialei, Sun Mingchen, & Xu Jiajin 2022) news sub-corpus, both of which contain a wide range of news discourse and are highly representative. They both adopt the BROWN family corpus paradigm, ensuring comparability. CROWN2021 and ToRCH2019 are balanced corpora of American English and modern Chinese, respectively, compiled by Beijing Foreign Studies University in 2021 and 2019, each containing approximately 1 million words. The English sub-corpus used in this paper contains 90,131 words, while the Chinese sub-corpus contains 88,539 words, with relevant statistical data shown in Table 1.

This paper is based on the semantic functions of adverbials, referencing Quirk et al. (1985) in the classification of adverbials. It divides functional components into eight categories: <time>, <place>, <manner>, <cause>, <effect>, <condition>, <purpose>, and <concession>, labeled as <time>, <place>, <manner>, <cause>, <effect>, <condition>, <purpose>, and <concession> respectively. The subject, verb, and object are labeled as <S>, <V>, and <O> to facilitate control over the same SVO structure in both English and Chinese. For clauses, they are treated as multiple SVO structures. Words or phrases that cannot be classified into the above functional blocks are not labeled, allowing for gaps. To balance efficiency and reliability, the currently leading comprehensive performance GPT-4o model API interface is used, combined with a Few-Shot Prompting strategy to guide the model according to the labeling system. Actual labeling examples and abstract versions are shown in example (2), and the labeling statistical results are presented in Tables 2–4.

4  The effectiveness and limitations of automatic labeling by large models have been discussed in academia. Although they can achieve or even surpass the capabilities of crowd-sourced annotators (Alizadeh et al., 2024) and have strong scalability, issues such as bias and hallucination still exist, and their capabilities in specialized knowledge are limited. However, methods such as enhancing data diversity and introducing model self-correction mechanisms can alleviate these problems (Tan et al., 2024). In light of this, this paper introduces Few-Shot Prompting, including three examples contrasting original sentences with manually labeled results, and provides examples for each category of functional blocks in the prompts. Although it cannot achieve the quality of human expert labeling on a sentence-by-sentence basis, this method ensures usability at the macro statistical level. The labeling process is conducted in parallel twice to simulate a dual annotator strategy, calculating labeling consistency after independently completing the labeling of the same batch of data, which is computed to be above 0.95.

3.3 Statistical Analysis  
This paper explores the distribution characteristics of functional blocks in English and Chinese news discourse and their syntactic order based on statistical methods, aiming to reveal the preference differences in constituent order between the two languages. Construction grammar (Goldberg 1995) points out that constructions and their internal components have cognitive fixation, stemming from categorization and patterning formed in high-frequency language input. The close relationship between constituent order and information structure can also be approximated as a form of preference fixation and generalization. In this process, constituent order gradually adapts to its semantic functions; at the statistical level, when achieving the same informational function, the preference for constituent order shows significant differences compared to the uniform distribution hypothesis.  
From this perspective, we can infer that if the relative position of functional blocks in a sentence shows significant differences (< 0.05) compared to the uniform distribution hypothesis, it indicates that their positional preferences have a certain systematization and stability within the language, with clear differences between languages. To this end, this paper combines conditional probability analysis, chi-square tests, independent sample t-tests, and Markov chain transition matrix analysis to explore the following aspects of intra-linguistic and inter-linguistic phenomena: (1) positional preferences of different types of functional blocks within sentences; (2) the combination patterns of functional blocks and the SVO framework; (3) patterns of multiple functional block arrangements and distribution tendencies.  
4. Research Findings  
4.1 Distribution Characteristics of Different Types of Functional Blocks within Sentences  
We first conducted chi-square tests comparing the distribution of each type of functional block within sentences to a uniform distribution (see Table 5). In Chinese news, various functional blocks show a significant tendency to be placed at the beginning of sentences (see Figure 1). In the chi-square tests for each type of functional block, <time> and <place> are highly concentrated at the beginning of sentences, providing temporal and spatial context upfront in the narrative. Additionally, <condition>, <concession>, and <cause> are also primarily located at the beginning of sentences, guiding the logical development of the sentence through initial setups. However, other functional blocks such as <manner>, <effect>, and <purpose> show relatively insignificant distributions. The histogram indicates that their positions within sentences do not exhibit clear preferences. These distribution preferences reveal characteristics of information organization in Chinese news discourse: the prominently placed functional blocks of <time>, <place>, <condition>, and <cause> construct a clear contextual framework for the narrative, while other functional blocks are flexibly distributed to meet varying contextual needs, closely related to the Chinese emphasis on wholeness and information buildup.

The intra-sentential distribution of functional blocks in English news also shows significant preferences, presenting a postpositional tendency that is opposite to that of Chinese (see Figure 2). Functional blocks emphasizing conditions or logical relationships, such as <Result>, <Purpose>, <Reason>, and <Concession>, are typically placed at the end of the sentence, highlighting explanatory supplements to the core information. <Time> and <Place> are also significantly concentrated at the end of the sentence, reflecting the characteristic of English that emphasizes the linear progression of temporal and spatial information. In contrast, the distribution of <Condition> shows weaker variability, but still exhibits a statistically significant tendency to be positioned towards the latter part of the sentence. These distribution patterns reveal a distinct feature of information organization in English news, where functional blocks are postposed to give way to core focal information, while maintaining a linear narrative logic, allowing the core of the event to gain greater cognitive priority at the beginning of the sentence.

Continuation of Figure 2  
In interlingual comparison, all functional blocks show significant differences under the t-test with p < 0.05 (see Table 5 for details). The distribution differences of <time> and <place> are the most significant; in Chinese, the temporal and spatial context is usually set at the beginning of the narrative, while English tends to place it later, aligning with a linear information progression model. The <manner> information is handled flexibly in Chinese, whereas English shows a stronger preference for post-positioning. There are also significant differences in the functional blocks that convey logical relationships; Chinese emphasizes logical groundwork, while English focuses on the post-expansion of logic. Overall, both English and Chinese exhibit stable and systematic preferences and patterns in the intra-sentential distribution of functional blocks.

4.2 Comparison of the Combination Patterns of Functional Blocks and the SVO Framework  
To explore the combinatory relationship between functional blocks and SVO, we first constructed the conditional probabilities of each type of functional block appearing before and after S, V, and O. Taking the conditional probability of <time> appearing before <S> as an example, we consider "the sentence contains the <time> functional block" as the conditional event and "<time> appears before <S>" as the target event. Thus, this conditional probability can be viewed as "the probability of <time> being positioned before <S> under the condition of achieving the <time> function."  
Analysis of Chinese shows that the distribution of functional blocks is more concentrated, clearly exhibiting a strong preference for pre-positioning regarding S, V, and O (see Table 6). Among the significantly different functional blocks, <time>, <place>, and <cause> are particularly prominent in their distribution before the verb and object; less significantly different functional blocks, such as <manner> and <condition>, show more flexible distribution before and after the subject, which may relate to the modifying role of functional blocks in the sentence. For instance, <manner> can modify both the subject and the verb, leading to a more balanced distribution before and after the subject. Overall, the combination pattern of Chinese functional blocks with S, V, and O demonstrates a strong preference for pre-positioning, while <manner> and <condition> are more flexible before and after the subject. This distribution difference reflects the characteristics of prioritizing background and flexible narration in the organization of information in Chinese.

| <manner> | 0.57 | 0.43 | 0.88 | 0.12 | 0.93 | 0.07 |  
| <place> | 0.72 | 0.28 | 0.94 | 0.06 | 0.94 | 0.06 |  
| <effect> | 0.58 | 0.42 | 0.67 | 0.33 | 0.72 | 0.28 |  
| <time> | 0.81 | 0.19 | 0.98 | 0.03 | 0.97 | 0.03 |  
| <purpose> | 0.61 | 0.39 | 0.81 | 0.19 | 0.84 | 0.17 |  
| <cause> | 0.78 | 0.22 | 0.96 | 0.04 | 0.92 | 0.08 |  
| <condition> | 0.69 | 0.31 | 0.93 | 0.08 | 0.89 | 0.11 |  
| <concession> | 0.77 | 0.23 | 0.96 | 0.04 | 0.95 | 0.05 |  

In contrast, the distribution of functional blocks in English shows greater flexibility, with smaller differences in conditional probabilities between the positions before and after (see Table 7). The distributions of <result>, <cause>, and <purpose> are slightly more frequent after the verb and object; the distributions of <time>, <place>, and <manner> are more balanced, with smaller differences, possibly reflecting that these functional blocks can be used to modify information at the beginning of the sentence as well as to provide supplementary explanations for the actions or objects at the end, demonstrating flexibility. Overall, the distribution of functional blocks in English is more uniform compared to Chinese, with <result>, <cause>, and <purpose> showing a certain tendency to appear later, while <time>, <place>, and <manner> are distributed more flexibly, with smaller gaps between positions. This distribution pattern reflects the diverse arrangement of functional block positions in English news, providing more freedom for narration while also highlighting its logical progression and syntactic core characteristics.

| <manner> | 0.37 | 0.63 | 0.40 | 0.60 | 0.32 | 0.68 |  
| <place> | 0.39 | 0.61 | 0.44 | 0.57 | 0.37 | 0.63 |  
| <effect> | 0.34 | 0.66 | 0.33 | 0.67 | 0.31 | 0.69 |  
| <time> | 0.40 | 0.60 | 0.44 | 0.56 | 0.41 | 0.59 |  
| <purpose> | 0.35 | 0.65 | 0.35 | 0.65 | 0.29 | 0.71 |  
| <cause> | 0.32 | 0.68 | 0.31 | 0.69 | 0.27 | 0.73 |  
| <condition> | 0.45 | 0.55 | 0.47 | 0.53 | 0.38 | 0.62 |  
| <concession> | 0.37 | 0.63 | 0.40 | 0.60 | 0.33 | 0.67 |  

Next, we extracted two sets of high-frequency functional blocks – SVO distribution patterns (see Appendix Tables 1 and 2). In specific Chinese corpora, the <place><S><V><O> is a typical distribution pattern, as seen in example (3)a, where multiple consecutive <place> appear before the subject, setting a rich and specific spatial background. This arrangement reinforces the common "from background to subject" logical structure in Chinese narratives. The <time><place><S><V><O> pattern demonstrates a tendency for the joint fronting of time and place functional blocks, as in example (3)b, where time and place functional blocks appear consecutively at the beginning of the sentence, clarifying the temporal and spatial scope of the narrative. This combination pattern further illustrates the regularity in the arrangement of functional blocks in Chinese news: by reinforcing the informational background with dual functional blocks, it provides ample groundwork and layers for the main clause's narration. Another typical pattern is <place><S><manner><V><O>, as in example (3)c, where <place> is at the beginning of the sentence to introduce the scene, and <manner> is inserted between the subject and verb to modify the manner of the action. This flexible combination reflects the adaptability of functional block distribution in Chinese news.

The findings are consistent with the conclusion that <manner> is distributed both before and after the subject. Through these typical patterns, it can be seen that the combination of Chinese functional blocks and SVO not only reflects the overall preference for fronting of functional blocks but also demonstrates characteristics of coordinated fronting and a certain degree of flexibility, partially revealing the rules of information background presentation and narrative logic in Chinese news.

(3)a <place>From high mountain snowfields to vast maritime territories</place>, <place>from border strongholds to urban and rural areas</place>, <place>canteens, bathrooms, reading rooms</place>… <S>The working and living environment of grassroots police officers</S><V>has always been</V><O>a matter of great importance and concern to the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Party Committee of the Ministry of Public Security</O>. (ToRCH2019-A01-38)

(3)b <time>Since 2018</time>, <place>the Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervision Commission of Dehua County, Fujian Province</place><S>have successively investigated</S><V>cases involving</V><O>two financial personnel from a state-owned enterprise embezzling huge amounts of public funds and a public official involved in a criminal case fleeing for 18 years</O>. (ToRCH2019-A10-33)

In English news, the distribution of functional blocks fully reflects the characteristic of supplementary information being placed after the main clause. The <S><V><O><time> structure is a highly representative distribution pattern of the post-modification characteristic of functional blocks. For example, in example 4(a), the SVO structure first directly conveys the key information. Subsequently, <time> unfolds gradually, providing specific background. This arrangement allows readers to quickly grasp the core information, while the temporal background information is gradually revealed at the end of the sentence, avoiding interference with the main structure from overly long introductory modifiers. The <S><V><O><place> pattern, as seen in example 4(b), also quickly presents the main event through SVO, while <place> supplements specific spatial information about the event through post-modification. This sentence structure similarly makes the core event description intuitive and concise, while the spatial background gradually unfolds at the end of the sentence, clarifying the context without interfering with the core information. The <S><V><O><time><cause> pattern reflects the supplementary role of functional blocks in logical relationships, as seen in example 4(c), where <time> and <cause> are added sequentially at the end of the sentence. This gradual post-modification, although not strictly following logical order, enriches the background and logic step by step while maintaining the conciseness of the main clause, making the organization of information easier to accept. These examples clearly reflect that English news achieves the expression strategy of "quickly presenting the subject-verb-object information, followed by gradually refining the background" through the post-modification of functional blocks. The fronting of the subject-verb-object and the post-modification of functional blocks work together to keep the narrative compact and efficient while providing space for the presentation of complex background information. This characteristic not only enhances the readability of the sentences but also strengthens the hierarchical organization of information.

4.3 The Order and Distribution Patterns of Multiple Functional Blocks

We first analyzed the multiple combination patterns of functional blocks and counted the high-frequency combinations of co-occurring functional blocks (complete results can be found in Appendix Tables 3 and 4). Looking at the top 10 for each language (see Tables 8 and 9), both Chinese and English have <time><place> as the highest combination, indicating that the two languages share similarities in the arrangement and combination of functional blocks.

Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Humanities, English Major, Fall 2024, "Corpus Linguistics" Course Paper, Ma Yiran, 2022212784

There is a certain degree of similarity, while overall both languages exhibit high flexibility. In Chinese, the combinations of <place><manner> and <place><time> have high frequencies, whereas English tends to concentrate more on causal and purpose functional blocks in high-frequency combinations, such as <time><cause> and <result><time>. Nevertheless, the two languages do not show significant differences, which may be related to the scale and scope of the corpus. It is noteworthy that combinations containing three functional blocks also appear in the statistics, but generally lack interlingual statistical significance, further illustrating that the combination patterns' flexibility is not concentrated in specific complex patterns.

Inspired by Markov chains, we further analyzed the conditional transition probability relationships between functional blocks (see Appendix Tables 5 and 6) and constructed a transition matrix heatmap (see Figure 3).

Figure 3 Functional Block Transition Matrix Heatmap

By comparing the results of the top 10 transition probabilities (see Tables 9 and 10), we found that the highest transition probability in Chinese is from <place> to <manner>, reaching 0.55, while <purpose> to <manner> and <condition> to <manner> also rank in the top three. In contrast, English shows higher transition probabilities from <condition> to <result> (0.33) and <cause> to <result> (0.28). The heatmap indicates that the functional blocks of <time>, <place>, and <manner> in Chinese exhibit particularly strong transitions, suggesting that Chinese tends to dominate the organization and narrative logic of information through the functional blocks of time, place, and manner, reflecting...

The significant characteristics of the Chinese news style in narrative include a strong sense of scene and background preparation; in contrast, the distribution of functional block transitions in English is more uniform, with <time> and <result> being slightly more dominant, indicating that English places greater emphasis on advancing information through logical connections in a linear manner. 

Overall, there is a certain tendency in the arrangement and distribution of multiple functional blocks in both languages, but this preference is not sufficient to form universally significant conclusions within the overall flexibility of usage. By integrating functional block combination patterns and transition matrix analysis, we speculate that this flexibility may reflect that the information organization in both languages does not significantly restrict the collocation of functional blocks, but rather allows them to combine freely according to contextual needs.

5. Discussion
5.1 The Functional Alignment of Information Organization and Deep-Level Drivers

Statistical results indicate that the English and Chinese news styles exhibit significant preferences in the sequence distribution of adverbial functional components, with the main differences reflected in the presentation order of core events and background information when achieving the same informational function. 

English typically adopts a "core information first" linear narrative model, constructing the skeletal structure of events at the outset and subsequently elaborating on background information such as time and place. This reflects Dryer’s (1986) "topic prominence hypothesis," which suggests that in terms of syntactic arrangement, English tends to place the grammatical core in a prominent position to enhance the explicit expression of information. This model makes the focus and logical mainline of the narrative clearer, thereby enhancing the directness and coherence of the information, making the core content easier to identify and remember.

In contrast, the narrative structure of Chinese leans towards a "background first" holistic elaboration model, where common expressions provide a framework for the narrative by detailing contextual information such as time, place, or manner, while the core event often appears at the end of the sentence as a "finishing touch," highlighting the coherence and completeness of the narrative through progressive and contextualized information. This characteristic also validates Rong Jing’s (2000) proposed "background-focus" structure in Chinese, which suggests that Chinese tends to support core events through contextual groundwork and guides readers into the narrative logic through progressive information unfolding. The aforementioned differences in component sequence preferences empirically support Wang Kangmao and Xiao Yan’s (1981) description of the syntactic characteristics of English and Chinese, indicating that English places greater emphasis on the concentration of information, while Chinese tends to favor semantic wholeness.

The differences between "core information first" and "background first" not only reflect the surface characteristics of the syntactic structures of the two languages but also reveal deeper mechanisms of cognitive patterns, semantic expression, and cultural traditions, possessing multidimensional theoretical significance and practical value.

Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Humanities, English Major, Fall 2024, "Corpus Linguistics" Course Paper by Ma Yiran, 2022212784

From the perspective of syntactic structure (Ji 2015), English tends to favor formality, with syntactic relationships marked by strict forms and relatively fixed rules, ensuring linear progression of information and logical coherence. In actual corpora, background information such as <time> and <place> is often placed later in the sentence, making the core events of the SVO framework more prominent in the logical main line. In contrast, Chinese emphasizes meaning and coherence, with syntactic relationships more often reflected through semantic connections and contextual inference. In Chinese corpora, functional blocks like <time> and <place> frequently appear at the beginning of sentences, constructing a complete narrative background before gradually unfolding the core events, highlighting the reliance of Chinese on overall semantics and contextual connections.

Differences in cognitive and cultural traditions further deepen the distinct preferences in English and Chinese word order. The cognitive model of English emphasizes a "division between the subject and the object," centering on clear subjects and predicates, distinctly differentiating between event participants and background information. This reflects the individual-centered and logically deductive thinking tradition in English culture, thus prioritizing the action logic of core events in narratives and placing background information later to gradually enhance the importance of the events. In contrast, the cognitive model of Chinese places greater emphasis on the holistic concept of "unity between heaven and humanity" (Jia Delin 1990; Zeng Jinghan 2015), culturally focusing more on the interaction between the environment and actions. In narratives, it tends to present background information first to showcase the interaction between events and contexts. For example, in reporting significant events, a grand narrative of time and space is created first, followed by the introduction of specific actions or outcomes (Scollon 2000). The high-frequency distribution of background elements like time and place at the beginning of sentences lays out background information, constructing a more complete semantic network and contextual information for the presentation of core events.

It is important to note that the features observed in this paper are largely constrained by the nature of journalistic discourse itself. Future research could explore the cross-genre consistency and variability of English and Chinese component order patterns by expanding the range of corpora and discourse types, providing deeper theoretical support for comparative language studies and cross-cultural communication.

5.2 Exploring the Influence of Semantics on Word Order

The conclusions drawn earlier are primarily based on statistical analysis of functional block labels, essentially decoupling word order patterns from the specific semantics of sentences and functional blocks. Although the distribution of functional block labels allows us to infer the word order preferences of the two languages, and we assume that the differences in functional block distribution are minimally related to semantics, mainly reflecting a cognitive construction, the potential impact of semantic differences in the corpus on word order differences cannot be completely ignored.

Previous semantic analyses of large-scale corpora have been time-consuming and labor-intensive, making efficient implementation difficult. However, modern large models, trained on vast amounts of data, contain deep representations of semantics within their parameters, allowing us to embed corpora as high-dimensional vectors and utilize these feature vectors for efficient semantic research. To this end, we used the MiniCPM-Embedding model to selectively embed the corpus and analyze the resulting high-dimensional feature vectors.

We first embedded two news sub-corpora and subsets of typical English and Chinese word order structures (<time><S><V><O> and <S><V><O><time>), then visualized the center vectors using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and calculated cosine similarity. The cosine similarity of the complete corpus of English and Chinese news sub-corpora was 74.07%, while the cosine similarity of the subset related to the <time> functional block was 62.04%, indicating that there are certain semantic differences in the overall semantics of the English and Chinese news corpora, but they are generally quite similar.

As shown in Figure 4, there are significant differences in local semantics within the corpora. Combining this with the earlier conclusions regarding word order preferences, we can only conclude that while the overall semantic differences are not substantial, local differences still exist. Therefore, we can assert that the influence of semantics on the differences in component order in English and Chinese news discourse is relatively small, but the role of semantic differences, especially local differences, should not be overlooked. Thus, the distribution of semantic features has a potential impact on word order choices to some extent; although the overall influence is limited, it may hold significant importance in specific contexts.

6 t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data, preserving the local neighborhood relationships between high-dimensional data points and revealing the local structural features of the data. Cosine similarity calculations are based on the directional relationships of global feature vectors, revealing overall data similarity while being less sensitive to local differences.

We further calculated the specific corpus content corresponding to the eight types of functional blocks using the same method. Each functional block has an overall semantic similarity close to or exceeding 85% (see Table 12). The functional blocks of <Time>, <Manner>, <Reason>, and <Concession> still exhibit a high degree of overlap in local distribution, while other categories show slight distribution differences (see Figure 5). This indicates that the semantic differences among the functional blocks themselves are not significant, suggesting that the contribution of semantic preferences to the distribution of functional blocks is relatively small. However, at the level of functional blocks, we cannot assume that semantics and word order are completely unrelated. The overall semantic similarity of functional blocks masks their local differences, and these local differences may be potential reasons for specific word order choices.  
Although embeddings can effectively capture the semantic features of the corpus, they also have limitations, such as a limited ability to depict deep connections in micro semantics and the potential to overlook dynamic pragmatic factors in high-dimensional space. Through variable control, we can only conclude that "the impact of semantics on word order differences is not significant but cannot be ignored," without further refining the specific mechanisms by which semantics influence word order. Future research could explore the complex interactions between semantics and word order within a richer range of corpora and functional blocks, combined with dynamic semantic modeling, to provide a more nuanced theoretical framework and empirical support for the study of English and Chinese word order.

5.3 Flexible Adaptation Mechanisms in Fixed Preferences

The component order distribution in English and Chinese news discourse shows significant patterns, but we believe these patterns are not entirely fixed; rather, they possess a certain degree of flexibility. This flexibility is mainly influenced by information structure, pragmatic needs, and specific contexts, reflecting a dual characteristic of both preference and adaptability in component order in English and Chinese. This observation provides new empirical support for academic debates on word order. For example, in English corpora, when certain background components carry important discourse functions, their positions may shift from post-verbal to pre-verbal, as in:

"The public defense of the court as a nonpartisan institution comes at a fraught time for the justices and their credibility. The Court's approval rating has dipped below 50% for the first time since 2017 and down 9 points from a decade high just last year, according to Gallup. <time>This month</time>, <S>the court</S> <V>became embroiled</V> <O>in a dramatic and highly divisive debate</O> <cause>over abortion in Texas</cause> (CROWN2021-A12AB)."

In this sentence, the previous context mentions the Supreme Court's "delicate" situation since 2017 and public doubts about its impartiality. The phrase "this month" naturally introduces a specific current case, directly reflecting this crisis of trust, transitioning from abstract time to a concrete fact. It is evident that the temporal component is fronted because it plays an important role in linking the preceding and following information in the discourse. Such adjustments demonstrate the flexible adaptability of English word order to pragmatic needs. Similarly, Chinese news also exhibits flexible arrangements of word order, as in:

"Three main 'intermediaries' came under the investigation team's scrutiny. The young man who met with Lai Shuangping on May 19, 2016, is named Liu Haiwen and is the head of Mingwei Company. This company had just won the bid for the audio and video equipment procurement project for the new venue on May 6, 2016. The person who met most frequently was Shao Zhengfei from Aima Company. From 2015 to 2016, this company won the bids for the 'self-service book borrowing and returning system' for both the new and old venues. <S>A woman in her 30s</S> <V>is named</V> <O>Yang Qin</O>, <place>from Dawei Company</place>, <time>won the bid</time> <O>for the new venue's furniture procurement project</O> in early 2016. It is suspicious that these winning bidders withdrew large amounts of cash within days of receiving the contract payments. Based on this suspicion, the investigation team decided to first lock onto three individuals through two lines of inquiry. One line is Aima Company, and the other is Dawei Company. (ToRCH2019-A05, 18-23)."

The core information in this sentence is the identity of the woman and her bidding behavior; thus, fronting the SVO aligns with the focus-first expression needs, while <time> and <place> serve as supplementary information placed at the end to form a causal relationship. From a discourse perspective, the overall structure presents a general-specific-general narrative, with the identities and actions of the three "intermediaries" forming a parallel relationship. Therefore, adjusting <place> and <time> to follow the core SVO, although this distribution does not completely conform to the overall preference of Chinese, aligns with the logical process of information reception by the reader and enhances the narrative's layered quality. This reflects the high adaptability of Chinese in organizing information, breaking through the traditional "background-first" model, achieving a balance between highlighting the focus and reinforcing logic.

The academic debate on whether word order has fixed rules often focuses on the relationship between grammar and information structure. On one hand, traditional research suggests that component order is influenced by typological differences, with syntax largely constraining information structure; on the other hand, recent studies increasingly emphasize the pragmatic driving force of word order, indicating that the choice of word order depends more on information focus, topic progression, and contextual adaptation. This paper, through a comparative analysis of English and Chinese news corpora, finds that component order exhibits both stable distribution patterns and flexibility driven by pragmatic needs. This flexibility reflects the language's adaptability to cognitive and information organization demands. For example, while the English principle of "dependency locality" encourages linear progression, in certain contexts, to highlight a topic or simplify cognitive load, some background information may be fronted. Conversely, while the Chinese "topic chain" structure emphasizes overall elaboration, when certain information focuses need to be highlighted, background information may be post-posed. These phenomena collectively illustrate the coexistence of preference and flexibility in word order, possessing a certain systematic preference while also having the ability to adjust flexibly. This dual characteristic provides a balanced explanation for the debate on whether word order is "fixed." The choice of word order is very...

To a large extent, it depends on pragmatic needs, information focus, and contextual logic. This not only expands our understanding of the syntactic features of English and Chinese but also provides an important reference direction for further research on the cross-genre patterns of word order.

6. Conclusion

Based on a large-scale English-Chinese news corpus and combined with automatic annotation from large language models, this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent order preferences and their arrangement patterns between the two languages from the perspective of functional blocks. The study finds that: (1) Elements such as time and place exhibit significant order preferences in English and Chinese news discourse. English tends to place these functional blocks at the end of sentences, reinforcing the central position of the core event's information; whereas Chinese shows a stronger tendency for fronting, highlighting the importance of background information at the beginning of the narrative. (2) The combination patterns of SVO structure and functional blocks reflect the differences in word order between English and Chinese news, but the degree of this difference varies. The fronting tendency in Chinese is significant, while the postposing characteristic in English is relatively mild, reflecting the different focuses of information organization in the two languages. (3) When multiple functional blocks co-occur, both English and Chinese news discourse demonstrate high flexibility in constituent order, with adjustments driven flexibly by information focus, pragmatic needs, and discourse functions. These findings reveal to some extent the differences in word order preferences in English and Chinese news discourse and the different strategies in information organization. They not only validate existing theoretical typological hypotheses about word order distribution but also provide new empirical support for the pragmatic adaptation mechanisms of word order.
